      - The Treehouse protocol that this new decoder allows Boring Vaults to interact with is owned by a multisig wallet that allows updating important values like a blacklist and setting allowed minters/burners for their associated tokens and setting upgrades. It is trusted that the owners of this mulitsig will act in the interest of users. It should be understood that a loss of Boring Vault funds is possible if this wallet acts maliciously.
