    ## Actors
    - `owner`: Multi-signature protocol account (3/5 sigs required).
        - Configure authorized peers (endpoint id ⇒ address) to send and receive cross-chain messages in the app. (Receiver and Sender)
        - Set the delegate, initialized to the same `owner` address on deployment. (Receiver and Sender)
        - Update `feeBps`, setting the `treasury`, `validator`, and `nextRound` fees. All values combined can not exceed `10_000`  BPS, representing 100% of the lot. (Receiver)
        - Update `minimumnBlockAge`, which represents the minimum age of the block guess. (Receiver)
        - Update `groupSize`, which represents the size of each block guessed. Initially set to `10` blocks. (Receiver)
        - Set the `permanentlySetDripVault` to prevent further vault migrations. (Receiver)
        - Can update the gas limit `lzGasLimit` used in `lzSend()` cross-chain message. (Sender)
        - Set the `gob` address, authorizing the GOB contract to deposit and withdraw from the vault. (Vault)
    - `delegate`: Set it to the same address as the `owner` during initialization.
        - Can make OApp configurations inside the endpoint.
    - `lzEndpoint`: LayerZero entry and exit point contract for cross-chain messages. It will receive the request sent by the `GuessOurBlockSender` contract and process and execute the `lzReceive` in `GuessOurBlockReceiver` through a valid executor.
    - `relay`: Protocol contract that processes and triggers each valid Herohlyph block with their proper graffiti data and executes tickers contracts.
        - Executes `onValidatorTriggered()` function.

    ### Assumptions
    - The owner will not maliciously change authorized peers. This could allow an arbitrary peer to send an encoded “block” and “validator” address at their discretion.
    - The LayerZero party will properly handle the cross-chain message validation, delivery, and execution of both chains.
    - Some vault integrations can be paused; APX ETH integration relies on the third-party integrator not pausing the contracts, and if paused, they will revert to the `deposit` and `withdraw` interactions.
    - `GuessOurBlockReceiver` fees will be set to a fair value, and the owner is entrusted with not setting these maliciously, as the `treasury` tax can be set to 100% of the value.
    - The Pirex ETH protocol will set no deposit fees.
