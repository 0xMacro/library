  <h2 id="tmaar">Trust Model, Assumptions, and Accepted Risks (TMAAR)</h2>
  <template type="audit-markdown">
    There are a couple of changes related to trust assumption being introduced in V2 contracts that have not been present in V1:

    1. Upgradability:

        `StakingRewardsV2`, `RewardEscrowV2`, and `EscrowMigrator` are now upgradable using the UUPS proxy.
    2. Pausability:
        - For `StakingRewardsV2`, `unstake` and `unstakeEscrow` can now be paused by the owner (in addition to `stake` and `stakeEscrow` which were already pausable in V1)
        - For `RewardEscrowV2`, depositing escrowed KWENTA (via `importEscrowEntry`, `createEscrowEntry`, `appendVestingEntry`), vesting (via `vest`), and transferring escrowed KWENTA can be paused by the owner
        - For `EscrowMigrator`, registering and migrating entries can be paused by the owner.
    3. Cooldown period:

        Cooldown period was added to lock staked amount for a meaningful amount of time (default: 2 weeks) to discourage disruptive short term action (such as buying of votes).
    
    In Addition, users migrating their KWENTA from V1 to V2 contracts need to be aware that there is a potential footgun where users need to overpay for migration. According to the Kwenta team, users are encouraged to follow the migration process provided on the Kwenta website to avoid loosing funds.
