      Spindl’s long-term goal is to build an attribution system native to Web 3 and how Web 3 developers perceive the world. 
      That means using a mix of off-chain and on-chain data to correctly measure the user’s journey toward a dApp, and their monetization and engagement once there. 
      Since this is a very nascent industry where business models have not coalesced, 
      the Spindl referral and rewards system does the bounty/revenue-share calculation off-chain in order to provide the app developer or marketer the maximum flexibility when it comes to incentivizing user growth. 
      Eventually, the attribution function will very likely live fully (or more fully) on-chain in a more decentralized and trustless manner.
