    <template type="audit-markdown">
        <b>MarketplaceV3</b> and <b>BurnToClaimDropERC721</b> contracts implement role-based access control including the roles listed below. In particular, DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE and EXTENSION_ROLE have high privileges such as making upgrades to the contracts. Both roles are assumed to be trusted and to act in a reliable and good manner.
        
        Specifically, the different roles have the following privileges:
        ### ******************************************MarketplaceV3******************************************
        `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`: grant and revoke roles; set platform fee info; set contract URI; set royalty engine
        
        `EXTENSION_ROLE`: add, replace, or remove extensions
        
        `LISTER_ROLE`: create listings and auctions. Only applies when restriction is enabled. By default, restriction is disabled so that everybody can create listings and auctions.
        
        `ASSET_ROLE`: Only NFT contracts with ASSET_ROLE can be listed or auctioned, when restriction is enabled. By default, restriction is disabled so that every NFT can be listed or auctioned.
        
        ### ******************************************BurnToClaimDropERC721******************************************
        
        `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`: grant and revoke roles; set platform fee info; set contract URI; set royalty info; set primary sale recipient; set owner; set claim conditions
        
        `EXTENSION_ROLE`: add, replace, or remove extensions
        
        `MINTER_ROLE`: lazy mint tokens; reveal the URI
        
        `TRANSFER_ROLE`: transfers to or from `TRANSFER_ROLE` holders are valid, when transfers are restricted.
