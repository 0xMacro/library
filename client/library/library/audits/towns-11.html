  <h2 id="tmaar">Trust Model, Assumptions, and Accepted Risks (TMAAR)</h2>
  ### End User

  Considered untrusted and potentially malicious. The system is designed to be defensive against users attempting to claim tokens for which they are not eligible.

  - The user's eligibility is strictly enforced by a cryptographic Merkle proof. The system assumes but also verifies that the user cannot forge a valid proof for an account they do not control or for an amount they were not allocated.
  - The user is responsible for providing the correct claim data (`conditionId`, `proof`, etc.) to the contract functions. The contract validates these inputs against the protocol owner configuration in the drop conditions.
  - A malicious user's actions are confined to their own claim attempts. They cannot impact the state or eligibility of any other user.
  - When calling `claimWithPenalty`, the user is responsible for using the correct `expectedPenaltyBps`. The contract verifies the expected bps against the claim condition bps match.

  ### Protocol Governance (Owner)

  Highly trusted. The owner is a privileged role and authorized entity that has complete administrative control over the airdrop conditions. This entity is trusted to:

  - Set, add, and overwrite claim conditions (`setClaimConditions`, `addClaimCondition`). This includes setting all parameters: start/end times, penalty rates, and the token to be distributed.
  - Correctly generate a unique Merkle root for each distinct airdrop campaign.
  - Provide the contract with a sufficient balance of the designated token to satisfy the `maxClaimableSupply` for all active claim conditions.

  ### Rewards Distribution Contract

  Trusted core infrastructure. The `DropFacet` trusts the `rewardsDistribution` contract (set during initialization) to perform staking operations correctly.

  - It is trusted to securely handle the staking of tokens on behalf of users via the `stakeOnBehalf` function. This includes correctly managing deposits, rewards, and withdrawals.
  - While the `DropFacet` can implement its own reentrancy guard, the security model inherently trusts that the `rewardsDistribution` contract will not perform malicious re-entrant calls.
  - Given the current implementation, no signature logic validation is present and the passed data is kept for backwards compatibility.

  ### Points Contract (TownsPoints)

  Trusted core infrastructure. The `DropFacet` trusts this contract to handle the burning of points associated with a claim.

  - Reviewed during the audit, points burn performs balance checks and proper balance deduction logic.
