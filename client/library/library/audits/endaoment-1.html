  <template type="audit-markdown">
    Endaoment is a nonprofit 501c3 and, as such, is legally required (through the Pension Protection Act of 2006) to have exclusive legal control over all contributions made to the system at any moment. Due to this, the contracts pose a centralization risk whereby the contract owner can shut down the portfolio; withdraw all assets; change the redemption, deposit, and AUM fees; and arbitrarily execute any function at any time. It is trusted that the owner will not abuse this power.
