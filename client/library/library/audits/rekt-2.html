      ### Trusted Entities:

      - Owner: RektClaimUpgradeable’s owner has the permission to withdraw all tokens, pause claiming, set the token being claimed, and set the signer. They are trusted to only make these calls when necessary and in the benefit of the protocol.
      - Signer: RektClaimUpgradeable’s signer is set by the owner and has the ability to sign Claim requests. It is trusted they only sign valid requests for what users are owed.
      - Upgrader: Can upgrade RektClaimUpgradeable’s logic. Is trusted to only do so when necessary and to benefit the protocol.
