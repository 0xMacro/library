  <h2 id="tmaar">Trust Model, Assumptions, and Accepted Risks (TMAAR)</h2>
  <template type="audit-markdown">
    The Farcaster protocol utilizes various privileged actors:
          <ul>
              <li>owner: can pause/unpause contracts and can modify many configuration parameters. </li>
              <li>guardian: can pause contracts. </li>
          </ul>
    All roles are assumed to be trusted and to act in a reliable and good manner. A more detailed description of the different actors and their assumptions can be found in the [documentation](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/contracts/blob/9b21c1fafbe1695c94d1305cb5ecbb3f59b51aa6/docs/docs.md).

    The following assumptions are made:
    <ul>
        <li>Owner is not malicious.</li>
        <li>Payment tokens will not include [weird ERC20s](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20). (We will likely stick to Base USDC for the near term, but want optionality to introduce a new token if necessary)</li>
        <li>We will validate that price per day is reasonable and correctly set for whatever payment token we select.</li>
        <li>We don’t care about validating that the FID emitted in the event is actually registered. If someone wants to pay $120 for a ID that isn’t registered yet, they can do so. Buyer and integrator beware.</li>
        <li>We limit “max days” per payment, but it’s possible to pay multiple times and register an unlimited number of days. We will not enforce a limit on Snapchain or in the contract, and will accept these payments, but it’s not in the user’s economic interest to do this.</li>
    </ul>
