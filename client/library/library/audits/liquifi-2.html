  <ul>
    <li>Discussions on Telegram with the {{page.clientName}} team.</li>
    <li>WeightedVoting contract being audited is created specifically for one client - Banger Games.</li> 
    <li>Description of the system in operation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The contracts are meant to be used in the following way:
    <ul>
        <li>We will deploy the <b>WeightedTokenVesting</b> contract, and Banger Games via our UI would create a bunch of vest plans, and finally set the <b>merkleRoot</b> field on the contract.</li>
        <li>Once all the vest plans are created and the final merkleRoot is updated on the WeightedTokenVesting contract, the owner of the contract would:
            <ol>
                <li>set <b>frozen</b> to <i>true</i>, this would not let the owner update the merkleRoot any further, freezing the contract.</li>
                <li>set <b>archivedTimestamp</b> to a future date where all the vest plans are vested: this will make sure the owner cannot archive/cancel any further vest plans.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>We will deploy the WeightedVoting contract at this point, seed it with the current state of vest plans and call <b>renounceOwnership</b> so that no further calls to <b>seedVestEvent</b> are possible.</li>
        <li>WeightedVoting contractâ€™s <b>getVotes()</b> method would be used in a snapshot strategy at Snapshot.org.</li>
    </ul>
