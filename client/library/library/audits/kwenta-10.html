    ### Entities

    - Users: Owners of a SynthetixV3 PerpsMarket account NFT, which give ownership and control of positions and collateral, as well as ability set specific permissions to other addresses for the account.
    - Delegates: Addresses that are given permission by an account owner to execute orders or sign conditional orders on behalf of the account owner.
    - Executors: Execute signed conditional orders once conditions are met and receive a conditional order fee. There are two types of executor
        - TrustedExecutor: This is an executor that is trusted to only execute a conditional order if conditions are met. Conditions are likely verified off-chain, so there is no guarantee all conditions are met when an order is attempting to be executed.
        - Normal Executor: Can be anyone, but the conditions set by the order are verified on-chain before execution of the order.

    ### Trust Model

    - Users that sign conditional orders trust that the order will be executed reasonably soon after the conditions are met, this may not be the case as there may not be executors taking orders at any given time, or gas costs could theoretically exceed conditional order fees.
    - If a trusted executor is used, there is trust that they only execute the order when conditions are met.
    - Any delegates given permission to execute conditional orders are trusted to act in the interest of the account owner.

    ### Accepted Risks

    - Synthetix could be exploited, potentially causing users funds to be lost.
