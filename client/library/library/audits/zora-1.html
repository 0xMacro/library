    <template type="audit-markdown">
        The Mints token contract itself is non-upgradeable, and assuming the set redeem handler for a token is immutable, users should always be able to receive the same or an expected amount of ETH or Tokens from redeeming relative to what they paid to mint.

        The Mints Manager is upgradable has the permission create new types of Mints tokens, as well as set the mints token that is available to be minted for a specific payment type. The current default ETH Mints token is currently used to by integrated Zora collections to determine the protocol fees for each Mint, which can be changed.
        
        The owner of the Mints Manager has the ability to upgrade it, as well as create and set default tokens, adjusting the price to purchase mints for any payment type, as well as set the protocol fee to mint on associated collections. The owner is trusted to set the cost of of Mints tokens to be reasonable to not adversely effect Zora collections, as well as to only upgrade the Mints Manager to benefit the protocol and/or its users.
