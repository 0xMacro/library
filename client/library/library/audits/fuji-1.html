  The security audit was performed by the Macro security team from Feb 13, 2023 to Mar 8, 2023.
  <p><strong>It is <span style="color:red">important</span> to note that Fuji is comparatively complex since it involves a lot of moving parts (lending, cross-chain, permits), hence we were able to find a significant number of issues.
  Most of these issues were on the surface level, hence there is the possibility of more issues once you go deep.
  Fixes resolution is also not ideal for these many issues, since all fixes increase the possibilities and do not allow reviewing them in isolation.
  Considering all of this, we suggest a reaudit to Fuji team.</strong></p>
  <p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> Fuji has chosen to get this audit with another audit provider for a fresh perspective, which we support and consider a sensible decision.
  This report includes fixes for critical and high issues only.</p>
