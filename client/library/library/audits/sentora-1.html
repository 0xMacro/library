        ## Trusted Entities:

        - Executor: Has the ability to call functions that facilitate strategies and rebalancing of assets amongst contracts, each contract in the project is expected to be an executor for the other contracts, as well as other trusted users. There is trust required that executors act in the best interest of the protocol.
        - Owner: Can call every function an executor can as well as administrative functions, and has the ability to pull assets out of contracts it owns. The owner is expected to be a boring vault that uses merkle tree verification on every call to ensure calls are not made maliciously. It is trusted that the owner of the boring vault sets up this merkle tree correctly and calls made are in the interest of the protocol. It is important to note that if maliciously setup, assets can be stolen from the contracts, however, Veda is expected to manage this and has done so without issue for multiple other protocols.
