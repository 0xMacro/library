      ## Actors

      ### Infinex Governance

      Protocol DAO that has control over contract implementation upgrades and configurations as the `Owner` role:
      - Controlling the Account factory migration and can enable or disable the account address prediction and creation.
      - Setting configuration parameters in the Procotol Configuration Beacon such as:
        - Setting proxy and account implementation addresses used for Account creation and migration. (Opt-in by Account control).
        - `trustedRecoveryKeepers` that sets or unsets an address as a trusted recovery keeper who can recover assets from accounts to the owner's recovery address if set.
        - `revenuePool` that sets the pool address where fees are sent to.
        - `USDC` address of the USDC token contract. (Opt-in by Account control).
        - `bridgeConfiguration.minimumUSDCBridgeAmount` minimum USDC amount that can be bridged. (Opt-in by Account control).
        - Wormhole and Circle bridging parameters. (Opt-in by Account control).

      ### Sudo Keys

      Super user set of addresses, initially set during the account creation as the Account owner but can be expanded to multiple Sudo key entities. 
      Essentially acts as the highest authority and can perform most actions such as set other Sudo keys, setup Operational keys, setup the Recovery key, upgrade Account's implementation, upgrade Configurations from the Protocol beacon, and perform withdrawals with the only exception being the emergency Recovery.
      
      ### Operation Keys

      Multiple Operation Keys can be added by any Sudo key and they can only execute intra-account bridging within different chains.
      
      ### Recovery Keys and Recovery Address

      A Sudo Key user can set the immutable Recovery Address once and enable Recovery Keys to recover USDC and tokens to this specific address. It is worth to note that the immutability of this address is only ensured within this Account's implementation as the logic might be migrated and allowed to change this variable. 
      Multiple Recovery keys can be added by any Sudo key, this special key actor can recover the USDC balance to a specific Circle CCTP Domain and ERC20 tokens, only if a Fund Recovery Address has been set as mentioned before. 

    ## External Assumptions 

    It is assumed that Infinex governance will set withdrawal fees, and that all account upgrades and beacon updates that accounts can opt into will be beneficial for users.

    ## Account Assumptions

    - Governance can update the upgrades to accounts, and the configuration beacons, but account owners can choose to opt into them or not.
    - Until accounts are deployed, given that the address of the deployed accounts is controlled by the factory, Infinex Governance has the power to disallow or allow the account deployment on both chains; before the full flow of an account’s creation is completed in both chains (L1 account and L2 account), it is assumed that no account implementation or beacon configurations changes would be applied.
    - Different key actors are designed to avoid a single point of failure if any of the keys were compromised. Users can decide how to design their account’s access control and potentially centralize all guards into a singleton key if this is added to all roles.
    - User’s funds are safe within the account as long as keys are not compromised, however, there are guards against single failure points to remove, recover, and add keys with different restrictions as described in the *Actors section.*

    ## Fees

    Current account implementations have a maximum withdrawal fee hardcoded in the Account of 50 USDC tokens. Withdrawals fees of different ERC20 tokens are also charged in USDC.
