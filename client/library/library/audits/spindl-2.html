        Spindl’s long-term goal is to be seen as the leader in the attribution space. 
        However, in order to achieve this goal, they want to start simple. 
        That is why in this current V1 set of contracts they have opted to limit and centralize most of the functionality to themselves, 
        in particular to the owner (a multisig wallet) and the worker (an address assigned to the server), both of which Spindl considers to be trustworthy. 
        It is trusted that the owner or worker will give every referrer their earned amount, and they will set each referrer’s and campaign’s status to their true status. 
        In addition, the owner will set the advertiser and worker to the proper addresses. In Spindl’s V2 set of contracts, they hope to move their contracts towards decentralization.
