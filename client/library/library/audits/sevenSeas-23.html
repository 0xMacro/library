      ## Trust Assumptions:

      AaveRewardsController: Is upgradeable so could potentially update logic and introduce vulnerabilities, caution is advised, however aave is a trusted entity across the ecosystem.

      Lombardâ€™s LBTC and cbBTCPMM: Both are upgradeable and owned by the same EOA owner, with recent updates and pending ownership transfers to a 3/5 safe. Caution is advised and we suggest waiting until ownership transfer occurs before moving funds in.

    <p>
      Specifically, we audited the AaveV3 and LombardBtc decoders, allowing boring vaults to claim rewards with AaveV3, as well as mint LBTC and swap CBBTC for LBTC. Changes reviewed from <a href="https://github.com/Se7en-Seas/boring-vault/pull/166">PR 161</a>.
