      ## Trust Model, Assumptions, and Accepted Risks (TMAAR)

      Trust Assumptions:

      In addition to the trust assumptions mentioned in [SevenSeas-4](https://0xmacro.com/library/audits/sevenSeas-4.html), this update allows interacting with Into the Block contracts, and holding positions with them. Each is intended to be setup with the vault as the owner, but will likely set Executors on deployment of each of Into the Block’s position managers. These executors are bots managed by Into the Block, and have the ability to manage positions that have been setup by the vault, but only the vaults can set approvals and withdraw assets. There is a trust assumption that these set executors will manage the vault’s assets as intended. As mentioned in I-1, there is also a trust assumption that contracts deployed are the same as those provided for this review, as the contracts are unverified and private.
