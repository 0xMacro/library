        ## Trusted Entities:
        Solver: Executes users signed intents to deposit or withdraw from the vault. They are trusted to execute these orders in a timely manner.

        Strategist: Can call [rebalance()](https://github.com/Veda-Labs/flux/blob/2085f721c4a2d66b41b2d6411115aa4f2759788d/src/managers/UniswapV4FluxManager.sol#L221-L315) to adjust assets in the vault. Allows them to swap tokens via accepted aggregators or directly with the corresponding uniswapV4 pool, as well as provide or remove liquidity. A portion of the profits from these rebalances, typically via rewards earned by providing liquidity, are distributed to the set `payout` address. It is trusted that they act in the best interest of the protocol, and to not manipulate the vault to extract profit.

        Admin: Can set the rebalance deviations, performance fees, payout address, the price oracle and trusted aggregators, Is trusted to set reasonable values, and set proper aggregators and price oracles. It is understood that a malicious aggregator or oracle could be used to extract value from the vault.

        Multisig: Can pause and unpause the Intents teller and the flux manager, preventing deposits, withdrawals or rebalancing. They are trusted to only pause these contracts when necessary.

        Owner: Can set deposit and withdrawal asset data, share lock period and intent max deadlines, as well as control permissioned operators as well as allowing and denying transfers for select users. They are trusted to set proper values that benefit the protocol, as well as only freeze transfers of those that are adversely effecting the protocol or its users.

        Denier: Can allow or deny users and operators to transfer shares. Like the owner is trusted to only freeze a users assets when necessary and in the interest of the protocol.
