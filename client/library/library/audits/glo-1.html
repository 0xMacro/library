        Notable features of the contract include minting and burning of GLO tokens, pausability, denylisting, and upgradeability. The contract implements a roles-based access control with dedicated roles for each of the aforementioned functionalities. The roles include:

        - `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` - can grant roles;
        - `PAUSER_ROLE` - can pause and unpause the contract;
        - `MINTER_ROLE` - can mint and burn GLO tokens;
        - `DENYLISTER_ROLE` - can add and remove from denylist;
        - `UPGRADER_ROLE` - can authorise an upgrade.
        
        It is worth noting that each role can be granted to any address which introduces a centralization risk whereby the user of the contract has to trust that all the roles will act faithfully.
