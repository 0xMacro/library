  <template type="audit-markdown">
    ### Entities

  - Users: owners of an account contract, which gives ownership and control of positions, collateral, allows setting orders, as well as the ability to set delegates.
  - Delegates: Addresses that are given permission by an account owner to execute orders or set conditional orders on behalf of the account owner.
  - Executors: Execute conditional orders set by the account owner or delegate once conditions are met in return for a conditional order fee. There are two types of executors.
      - Gelato: Protocol setup to execute functions when set conditions are met. The fees the account pays is dynamically calculated by gelato itself based on gas used and gas price.
      - Normal Executor: Any address can execute a conditional order, the fees payed for executing a conditional order is set by the owner of the Settings contract.
  - pDAO: The owner of the Factory and Settings contracts, and a 3 of 5 multisig found [here](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xe826d43961a87fbe71c91d9b73f7ef9b16721c07). They have the ability to set account upgrades, whitelist tokens, pause account execution, and set executor fees.

  ### Trust Model

  - Users that set conditional orders trust that the order will be executed reasonably soon after the conditions are met, this may not be the case as there may not be executors taking orders at any given time, or gas costs could exceed conditional order fees.
  - Any delegates set by the account owner are trusted to act in the interest of the account owner.
  - Accounts are upgradeable and can be upgraded by Kwenta governance as the owner of the factory contract, so it is trusted that Kwenta governance does not act maliciously and upgrades are only made to benefit users.

  ### Accepted Risks

  - Synthetix could be exploited or governance could be compromised, potentially causing users funds to be lost.
  - Kwenta governance could be compromised, allowing malicious upgrades to accounts to steal assets.
