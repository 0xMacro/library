       ### Actors
        - **`ClaimableFactory` Owner**: The owner of the factory contract. They are trusted to deploy new Claimable contracts with the correct implementation logic and legitimate parameters (Merkle root, token, and role addresses).
        - **`Claimable` Owner / Upgrader**: The owner of an individual Claimable contract. They can upgrade the contract's logic and change its Merkle root at any time. This is a highly trusted role, relied upon not to introduce malicious code or alter claim rules to their benefit.
        - **Pauser**: The holder of the `PAUSER_ROLE` for a Claimable contract. They are trusted to only pause or unpause claiming during a legitimate emergency and not to cause a denial of service.
        - **Withdrawer**: The holder of the `WITHDRAWER_ROLE` for a Claimable contract. They can withdraw all tokens from a contract, but only if it is paused. They are trusted to act only in emergencies and to handle funds responsibly.
        - **Token Deployer**: The initial creator of the Myriad (MYR) token. They are trusted to mint the correct supply, making it immutable and setting the total supply on deployment.
