# Demystifying EVM Opcodes

The following talk was given at ETH Global in 2022. It's a great primer for what you will learn in this course.

The video itself is *almost* timeless ðŸ™‚ It has the following errata:

- The memory address increments at 10m 30s should increment by `0x10` instead of `0x20`, i.e. `0x00`, `0x10`, `0x20`, `0x30`, etc.
- The crossed out `PUSH1 0x01` at 26m 14s should read `PUSH1 0x07`.

The slides have been updated and are accessible [here](https://learnevm.com/assets/demystifying-evm-opcodes.pdf). Note that they aren't quite the same without the animations, so pairing them with the video is still advised.
