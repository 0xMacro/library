# About This Course

LearnEVM.com is designed to be a mix of two things:

1. A reference manual you can return to when dealing with the gritty details of each chapter, and:
2. A course/tutorial, as the content is sorted such that you can read from beginning to end in a progressive manner.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this course, you should try and be familiar with:

- What Ethereum is and why we can run code on it.
- Generally what the fields for a transaction are.
- How transactions make it from wallet to chain.
- A rough mental model of how contracts run on-chain.
- Writing smart contracts in Solidity or a similar language.
- A basic idea of how CPUs run low-level instructions.

## Learning Objectives

After going through this course, you will:

- Understand what it means for the EVM to be a virtual machine.
- Understand what the EVMâ€™s execution environment is and how to work with it.
- Have a deep understanding of how contract deployment works, and how Solidity deployment patterns work under the hood.
- Understand how function calls work, and the differences between the CALL variants.
- Understand the anatomy of ABI encoded function calls.
- The inner workings of common Solidity idioms.
- The inner workings of Solidity data structures and their security implications.
- Common Solidity gas optimizations based on their compiled SLOAD/SSTORE opcodes.
- How to write smart contracts in raw opcodes ðŸ˜Ž

Each chapter has its own collection of intricate details; the above is only speaking generally.

## Exercises

In an ideal world, each chapter and section would have some self-paced points and exercises. However, our audits team is also busy with audits.

Therefore, in the interest of launching sooner than later, the first version of this content will release with a lack of such, and will be appended in the future.
