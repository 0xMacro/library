# Why Learn ABI Encoding?

Whether you‚Äôre aware of it or not, Application Binary Interfaces (ABIs) are used **everywhere** within the inner workings smart contracts and typical Ethereum transactions. As a Solidity / EVM developer, you will *inevitably* run into strange and unusual scenarios where solid knowledge of ABIs will *guide* you to solving the obstacles you face.

In short, ABIs are used **any time a contract needs to respond to a function call.**

As you can imagine, this can be very common. Let‚Äôs explore the common situations where ABIs are used:

- <toc>Transaction Data</toc>
- <toc>Contract-to-Contract Function Calls</toc>
- <toc>Hardhat & Frontend Applications</toc>
- <toc>Smart Contract Design Patterns</toc>

## Transaction Data

Any time you call a contract function on-chain using your wallet, you are sending an ABI-encoded function call.

A common example of using ABI-encoded transaction data is making a trade on [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org). Let‚Äôs say you want to swap ETH for USDC. You would:

- Visit the [swap page](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap) web frontend and connect your wallet.
- Select ETH and USDC, enter in an amount, and click ‚ÄúSwap‚Äù:

<div class="w-2/3 mx-auto">

![Swapping ETH to USDC on Uniswap's web ui](/img/abi-swap-1.png)

</div>

Upon clicking that button, the page‚Äôs JavaScript **prepares an ABI encoding** of the function selector and arguments, and prompts you (via e.g. MetaMask) to **create and send** a transaction **with that ABI encoded data as the transaction‚Äôs `data` field**, to be sent to the contract you‚Äôre using to trade.

To continue this example, let‚Äôs take a look at what this data *looks* like, and in a future chapter we will learn the details of the encoding algorithm itself.

Below is a screenshot of what the MetaMask prompt could look like after clicking the ‚ÄúConfirm Swap‚Äù button:

<div class="w-1/2 mx-auto">

</div>

Note the `HEX` tab ‚Äì that‚Äôs what we want to look at next:

![MetaMask confirmation dialog showing the HEX tab](/img/abi-swap-3.png)

See that `HEX DATA: 420 BYTES` field? This is what ABI encoded data looks like! It may look scary now, but after completing the next few chapters, you will have a solid understanding of what this data is really doing.

## Contract-to-Contract Function Calls

The `HEX DATA` we just saw above is **the exact same format of data** that contracts use to *interact* with each other **on-chain**.

Concretely, any time you see an external function call in Solidity:

```solidity
uint result = someExternalContract.foo(10);
```

This call compiles down to code that:

1. **Constructs** an ABI-encoded message (i.e. the function selector + arguments),
2. and **sends** that message to the `someExternalContract` address using the CALL opcode (more on that opcode later).
3. The contract bytecode located at the `someExternalContract` address then **interprets** that call, **ABI-decoding** the incoming message, running its own logic, and eventually **ABI-encoding** a return value.
4. The calling contract receives back the return value, **ABI-decodes** it, and continues execution.

Here is some Solidity code that is roughly equivalent to the above code snippet:

```solidity
// This Solidity code:
//
//    uint result = someExternalContract.foo(10);
//
// is roughly equivalent to the following:
//
(bool success, bytes memory returnData)
  = someExternalContract.call(abi.encodeWithSignature('foo(uint256)', [10]));

require(success, "foo failed");

(uint result) = abi.decode(returnData, (uint));
```

There are more detail we could cover, but we‚Äôll stop here and move on since this is only the introductory ‚Äúwhy should I learn this?‚Äù lesson üôÇ

## Hardhat & Frontend Applications

Both [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org) and frontend applications use [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) or something similar. This library allows you to write JavaScript code that looks like this:

```solidity
await greeterContract.setGreeting("Hello!");
```

This is nice, but how does ethers.js know what this function should do? It‚Äôs because of **the contract‚Äôs ABI declarations** that get generated during compilation.

For example, when you compile Solidity with Hardhat, Hardhat generates JSON files that look like the following:

![Example JSON Hardhat output of a compiled Solidity smart contract](/img/abi-artifacts.png)

In this example:

- Hardhat compiled a Greeter.sol, generating a file located at `artifacts/contracts/Greeter.sol/Greeter.json`
- This file contains the ABI: The declared **interface** of this contract. In other words, these are the functions that the contract is ‚Äúpromising‚Äù to the world that it will respond to, in some form or fashion.
- Ethers.js **reads this file**, and uses the `abi` array to **generate** JavaScript functions that can be used like the `await greeterContract.setGreeting("Hello!")` snippet above.

## Smart Contract Design Patterns

Lastly, understanding ABIs will open the gate to fully understanding:

- **Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs).** Proposals to Ethereum must consider all edge cases, and much of these considerations are at the binary data level.
- **Solidity‚Äôs low-level `externalContract.call()`.** ABIs are part of the low-level concept that [the Solidity docs refers to](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.16/control-structures.html#external-function-calls).
- **DAO proposal systems.** Governance voting for on-chain execution is exactly ABI-encoded function calls stored in a voting proposal struct.
- **Gasless transactions.** [EIP-2771](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2771) *extends* ABI calldata for its own needs.
- **Contract proxy patterns,** especially how function calls are delegated.
- **Deploying contracts through a multisig,** and its tricky function signature & arguments.
- Much, much more ü§ì
