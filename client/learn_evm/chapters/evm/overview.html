# The EVM Execution Environment

The **environment** in which bytcode is executed is the collection of *resources* that bytecode has access to.

Specifically, bytecode has access to:

- The stack
- Memory
- Contract storage
- A finite amount of gas
- Various fields of information about the running transaction, including calldata, the running contract, and its caller.

In the following chapters, we will go over the first three in greater detail.

<aside>A somewhat unique aspect of the EVM is that **it has no registers.** Registers are slots where you can temporarily stash data to pull out a bit later. In the name of simplicity, the designers of the EVM opted not to include them.</aside>

## Three Worlds of Data

The stack is not the only data location you have to work with. Specifically, you have access to:

- The stack. Push, pop, dupe, and swap are the base operations you have access to.
- Memory. A location to read/write data that will only last as long as a function call (an EVM function call, to be clear; Solidity has a different definition of a function call).
- Storage. A location to read/write data that will persist across function calls and transactions.

<aside>You also have access to calldata, although one could argue calldata is read-only memory.</aside>

And that's it. These three data locations make up the execution environment that all contracts run in on-chain.

In the following chapters, we’ll discuss the details of working with each one.


## Function Call Environments

Generally speaking, **each function call gets its own, isolated execution environment.** Namely:

- A new, empty stack.
- New, empty memory.
- Access to the running contract address’s storage.
- A finite amount of gas to run.

The details of how function calls work is described in <chapter>fn/actor</chapter>. For now, just keep in mind that function calls do not share stack nor memory.
