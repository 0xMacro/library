# Binary and Types on the EVM

Solidity has many useful types: `uint256`, `bool`, `string`, `struct`, `mapping`, arrays, and so on.

However, **the EVM itself does not have any awareness of these types**. There are no opcodes that deal with or are aware of most Solidity types. Instead, they deal with much lower level types, as we will see below.

## A Review of Binary

If you're already familiar with binary and bytes, feel free to skip this section.

For those that need a refresher, here's a quick review:

- Binary is a string of zero's and one's (0's and 1's)
- Each 0 or 1 is called a **bit**.
- 8 bits = 1 byte — for example, `0101 1000` is one byte (the space in between is just to make it more readable).
- Binary is raw data. It doesn't have a type.
- However, we can **interpret** binary values *as* a type.
    - By “we”, I mean we as humans, or we as the programs we write.
    - For example, we can interpret `0101 1000` as an **unsigned integer,** converting each bit to its respective power of 2:
        - `0+64+0+16 + 8+0+0+0` = `88`
    - On the other hand, we *could* interpret the same value as [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII), which is the letter `x`.
- 1 byte has 256 possible values.
    - `0000 0000`, `0000 0001`, `0000 0010`, `0000 0011`, `0000 0100`, etc.
    - As an unsigned integer, the minimum value for 1 byte is `0`, while the maximum is `255`.

## EVM's Native Types

The “types” that the EVM understands is:

- Unsigned numbers (`uint256`) – `ADD`, `SUB`, `LT`, `GT`, `GAS`, `CALLVALUE`, `TIMESTAMP` etc.
- Signed numbers (`int256`) – `SIGNEXTEND`, `SDIV`, `SLT`, `SGT`, etc.
- Binary – `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `BYTE`, `SHL`, `SHR`, `SHA3`, `BLOCKHASH`, etc.
- Addresses – `ADDRESS`, `SENDER`, `CALL`, etc.
- Contract bytecode – `CREATE`, `CODECOPY`, `EXTCODECOPY`, etc.

All other types that you see in Solidity are built on top of the above.

Note that *any* value in the EVM – whether on the stack, in memory, or storage – is all just binary, and only **interpreted** as a type the moment an opcode *operates* on that data.

## The 256-bit word size

A **word size** is something that all machines have – it's the “natural chunk size” of data that they operate in.

But what does that mean?

Fundamentally, your computer has limits. It has a limited amount of memory, a limited amount of disk space, and so on.

The same kind of limit exists at the lowest level of binary. For a machine, **stack items** must have a limit of *some* length.

**The EVM's stack item size is its word size: 256 bits (32 bytes)**.

This means every stack item is exactly 256 bits. No more, no less. A single boolean, for example, will take a full 256 bits on the stack, even though booleans only need one bit to be fully represented. That's potentially a lot of unused space.

Note again, just to be clear: The EVM has no built-in concept of a boolean.

</aside>

EVM's large word size has many implications about how you can interact with the system. Let's explore each one.

### Data Size for a Stack Item

As hinted, each item on the stack is a full 32 bytes. Any items that an opcode puts on the stack will be exactly this size; there is no way to specify otherwise.

### Delegating to Memory

As large as 32 bytes is, not everything can fit in a single word. Complex data structures such as arrays and strings take *at least two* full words – one for the length, and one plus for the data.

Because of this, often times you will have to move data to memory instead of the stack. The most common example of this is the `RETURN` opcode; in order to return data from a function call, you must put that data **into memory first**, and *then* execute the `RETURN` opcode with what location in memory that data resides.

You'll learn more about working with memory in <chapter>evm/memory</chapter>.

### Key Space

When working with memory, you specify a **memory offset** – a 32-byte offset, starting from zero, of where your data resides in memory.

When working with storage, you specify a **storage key** – a 32-byte key, of any value, of where you want to read or write a 32-byte value of data.

Consider how a 32-byte key has 2^256 possible values. That's an incredibly large number:

```solidity
2^256 = 115,792,089,237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,853,269,984,665,640,564,039,457,584,007,913,129,639,936
```

This works out well **for storage**, since EVM storage is similar to a key-value database. An arbitrary key can be assigned an arbitrary value. It's a benefit to have such a large key space, as it helps avoid conflicts.

But **for memory**, you will never reach anywhere near the max range. Starting from zero, any memory you use **costs additional gas** for allocation. For example, using an offset of `0xff` is fine; using an offset of `0xff000000000000000000` is not.

### Storage Values

Contract storage values are also limited to 256 bits. This is one benefit to having the word size so large; you can store and retrieve large values – such as keccak hashes – much easier.

For example, if the EVM were 64-bit instead, you would have to break up an address into three 64-bit storage slots, complicating reads and writes.

### ABI Encoding

When you send a message to call a function, you send function arguments along with it. These arguments are encoded using ABI encoding, which generally encodes data using EVM's word size.

This means, just like the stack example, encoding a `bool` for a function call will take a full 32 bytes in the ABI encoded message. That's potentially a lot of unused space.

You'll learn more about ABI encoding in the ABI chapters, specifically in <chapter>abi/anatomy</chapter>.

### Keccak Hashes

Another benefit for the 256-bit word size is the convenience of working with keccak hashes, which take a full 32 bytes. These hashes can be manipulated directly on the stack.
