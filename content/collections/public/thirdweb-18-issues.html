        ## [M-1] Pulling tokens after initiating the token purchase potentially fails

        In the PaymentsGateway contract, when calling `initiateTokenPurchase` with some ERC20 token set as `tokenAddress`, the specified `tokenAmount` is transferred to the PaymentsGateway contract and approval is given to the `forwardAddress`:

        ```jsx
        SafeTransferLib.safeTransferFrom(req.tokenAddress, msg.sender, address(this), req.tokenAmount);
        SafeTransferLib.safeApprove(req.tokenAddress, req.forwardAddress, req.tokenAmount);
        ```

        The expected behavior of the forwarder contract is to pull the tokens from the PaymentsGateway contract in the same transaction as `initiateTokenPurchase`. However, as this can’t be guaranteed for all forwarder contracts, the following issue can occur: 

        1. `initiateTokenPurchase` is called with `tokenAmount` of `10_000` and `forwardAddress` of `0x123`. 
        2. At this stage, the `PaymentsGateway` token balance is `10_000`
        3. Before the tokens are pulled by the forwarder contract, another `initiateTokenPurchase` is done with `tokenAmount` of `1_000` using the same `forwardAddress` of `0x123`
        4. Now, the PaymentsGateway token balance is `11_000`

        However, the forwarder contract can now only pull `1_000` tokens instead of `11_000`, as this was the latest value that was approved. The issue occurs because on the `safeApprove` call, the exact `tokenAmount` is set without considering any previous approvals that have not yet been pulled.

        **Remediation to Consider**

        Increase the allowance by the `tokenAmount` instead of setting it exactly to the `tokenAmount`.
    </field>
    <field name="response">
        Looking at the forwarders we plan to use, the forwarder will pull the tokens in the same transaction. Also, it may add extra steps to keep track of allowance and set it to an increased value etc. We'll add this change if we use other forwarders in future that require this kind of setup.

        ## [L-1] Airdropping tokens using push or signature-based methods can be griefed
        
        In the Airdrop contract, the push and signature-based airdrop methods are susceptible to a griefing attack. When iterating over the array of provided `_contents`, execution control is given to the recipient in certain situations, depending on the token standard and airdrop type being used:
        
        - `airdropNativeToken` gives execution control to the recipient when executing the low-level `.call` method.
        - `airdropERC20` gives execution control to the recipient by internally calling `tokensReceived` hook when the provided token is compatible with ERC777 standard.
        - `airdropERC721` gives execution control to the recipient by internally calling `onERC721Received` hook.
        - `airdropERC1155` gives execution control to the recipient by internally calling `onERC1155Received` hook.
        
        As a result, a recipient contract can execute malicious code, such as consuming all the provided gas. If this occurs, calls could cost substantially more than expected or exceed the block gas limit, preventing calls from executing.
        
        If this happens, the owner could always execute the airdrop again by omitting the malicious recipient for push-based airdrops. For signature-based airdrops, the owner would need to create a new signature excluding the malicious recipient. 
        
        **Remediation to Consider**
        
        - Explicitly pass in the amount of gas for the transfer, ensuring there is enough gas to allow the contract to execute normal operations, but not provide the entire gas of the transaction that can be used maliciously.
        - As a minimum, appropriate comments should be added to the susceptible airdrop functions, making above shortcoming clear to any caller.

        Gas estimation should be able to detect if a griefing recipient is in the list.

        ## [L-2] Completing the token purchase potentially locks native tokens
        
        In PaymentsGateway’s `completeTokenPurchase`, native tokens can get locked in the contract in the following ways:
        
        1. User accidentally sends `msg.value > 0` when specifying an ERC20 token as `tokenAddress`. All `msg.value` passed will be locked.
        2. User sends `msg.value > tokenAmount` when specifying the native token as `tokenAddress`. The excess amount (`msg.value - tokenAmount`) will be locked.
        
        The owner of the contract could withdraw locked tokens and give back the overpaid amount to the user via the `withdrawTo` function. However, it is recommended to prevent above scenario in the first place.
        
        **Remediation to Consider**
        
        - In case of `tokenAddress` is an ERC20 token, don’t allow `msg.value > 0` to be passed
        - and in case of `tokenAddress` is the native token, make sure `msg.value == tokenAmount`

        ## [L-3] Initiating the token purchase doesn’t correctly account for fee-on-transfer tokens
        
        In PaymentsGateway, the `initiateTokenPurchase` function doesn’t correctly account for tokens that apply a transfer tax, which results in less value transferred than the `tokenAmount` specified.  
        
        However, the `tokenAmount` is approved to the `forwardAddress`, allowing the forwarding contract to pull the full `tokenAmount`, rather than the `tokenAmount - fees`:
        
        ```jsx
        SafeTransferLib.safeTransferFrom(req.tokenAddress, msg.sender, address(this), req.tokenAmount);
        SafeTransferLib.safeApprove(req.tokenAddress, req.forwardAddress, req.tokenAmount);

        ## [Q-1] Missing `natspec` documentation

        The Airdrop contract is entirely missing appropriate `natspec` documentation. Note that `natspec` documentation is considered as good practice to make the intent of the function clear to users.

## [Q-2] Make `processed` mapping public


In the Airdrop contract, the `processed` mapping is used to track already processed requests and prevents replay attacks. This information can help users or other contracts to check the status of a request using the request Id. However, because the `processed` mapping is declared as `private`, the processed status cannot be retrieved easily. 

Similar issues exists with the `processed` mapping in the PaymentsGateway contract.

**Remediation to Consider**

Make the `processed` mapping `public`.

        ## [Q-5] Use `safeTransferETH` instead of low-level call
        
        In the `withdraw` function, `SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH` is used to transfer native tokens to the caller. However `airdropNativeToken`, uses the low-level call directly:
        
        ```jsx
        (bool success, ) = _contents[i].recipient.call{ value: _contents[i].amount }("");

        **Remediation to Consider**
        
        For readability and consistency reason, use `safeTransferETH` in the `airdropNativeToken` function to transfer native tokens to the recipient, instead of using the low-level call.

        ## [G-1] Use `verifyCalldata` to verify Merkle tree
        
        Solady’s [MerkleTree library](https://github.com/vectorized/solady/blob/main/src/utils/MerkleProofLib.sol) offers two ways to verify a provided leaf is in a Merkle tree, one where the proof is provided as memory with the regular `verify()` function, and another that takes the proof as `calldata` using `verifyCalldata()`. When a user claims tokens and provides a proof, it is passed in as `calldata`, since it is not altered during execution. `calldata` is cheaper to read than memory, which leads to less gas consumed for users to verify their claims if the function `verifyCalldata()` is used rather than `verify()`.
