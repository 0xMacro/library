    ## [H-1] `subscribe()` not callable for other user after their first subscription expires

    The `subscribe()` function mistakenly compares the `user` subscription end date against `block.number` instead of `block.timestamp`. This prevents a user X from calling `subscribe()` for a user Y if user Y has an expired subscription.

    Consider updating `block.number` to `block.timestamp`.

    ## [H-2] `extendSubscription()` front-run vulnerability

    In `extendSubscription()`, the user’s current subscription is used to calculate how many additional tokens are required to extend the subscription up to the specified `end`.

    However, a user may be able to get the extender to pay more than they intend. For example:

    1. User X has a subscription from time `200` to `500` with rate `7`. Current time is `230`.
    2. Extender calls `extendSubscription()` with user X’s address and an end time of `800`.
    3. User X front-runs transaction with:
        1. `unsubscribe()`, also getting a refund
        2. `subscribe()` with `start` as now, with `end` as a small amount after (such as `315`), and with `rate` as high as they can afford.
    4. Extender, intending to pay for `250` seconds of time, is now paying for `435` seconds, and at a much higher rate than intended.

    This issue affects extenders linearly with approval size.

    Consider updating `extendSubscription`’s parameters to include a `intendedRate` so the extender’s paid rate cannot be front-run.

    Also consider replacing `end` with `secondsToExtend` so extenders cannot pay for more time than they intend.

    ## [H-3]  `fulfil()` reverts or loses funds when user has an active subscription

    A use case supported by the Subscriptions contract is allowing a third party to call `fulfil()` on a user’s pending subscription, converting the pending into an actual subscription and paying for it.

    If the targeted user already has an existing subscription, `unsubscribe()` is called to refund the user before converting the pending subscription.

    However, the `unsubscribe()` function only refunds `msg.sender`, which is different than the user in this use case. This causes one of the following issues:

    - If the `msg.sender` has an active subscription, the `msg.sender`’s subscription is unsubscribed, and the target user’s subscription is overwritten, losing access to those funds.
    - If the `msg.sender` does not have an active subscription, the call reverts with `no active subscription`, and the use case is blocked from functioning.

    Note that the subscription status of either party can be freely switched from no-subscription to active-subscription by way of `subscribe()`, allowing a griefer to set up these scenarios at low cost.

    Consider implementing an internal function `_unsubscribe(address)` which accepts an address, and calling it from `unsubscribe()`  with `msg.sender`, and from `_subscribe()` with `user`.

    ## [M-1] Calling `subscribe()` with incorrect values can lock funds in contract

    The `subscribe()` function allows `start` and `end` values to have a maximum value of `type(uint64).max`, but the `start` value can be truncated during cast to `int64` on lines [361-362](https://github.com/edgeandnode/subscription-payments/blob/81a44aede886fc972b2f2422038a804f00789966/contract/contracts/Subscriptions.sol#L361-L362) of `unlocked()`:

    ```solidity
    uint256 len = uint256(
        SignedMath.max(
            0,
            **int256(int64(_subEnd)) -
                int256(Math.max(block.timestamp, _subStart))**
        )
    );
    ```

    As a result, `unsubscribe()` can mis-calculate the refund and leave a portion of funds locked in the contract.

    Consider restricting subscription  `start` and `end` to a maximum value of `type(int64).max`.

    ## [L-1] `subscribe()` griefing attack

    When user X calls `subscribe()` to create a subscription for user Y, a malicious user Z can front-run the transaction by calling `subscribe()` themselves with a long `end` and a minimal `rate`.

    This can disrupt the [assumingly less-common] use case of a machine user granting a user a subscription upon some event.

    Consider one or many of:

    1. Extending the pending subscription feature to cover this use case
    2. Documenting the limits of this approach, particularly not to build a system around it
    3. Removing this feature

    ## [L-3] Minor Reentrancy

    The `_subscribe` has a minor reentrancy vulnerability:

    - If the user has a sub, then `_unsubscribe` is called
    - This transfers tokens to the user (for a refund), giving an opportunity for reentrancy
    - This reentrancy occurs *before* `subscriptions[user]` and the new epoch states get updated.

    However, this causes the attacker to lose money, as their old subscription data is overwritten with the new, with no chance to retrieve the funds for the old.

    This shouldn't cause any problems. However, if extra safety is desired, consider adding OZ's `nonReentrant` modifier to `subscribe`, `unsubscribe`, and  `fulfil`.
