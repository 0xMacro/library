        ## [Q-1] `IWormholeReceiver` interface is not up to date

        The `IWormholeReceiver` interface used in connext-monorepo is not up to date with the [wormhole-foundation interface](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/ethereum/contracts/interfaces/relayer/IWormholeReceiver.sol). The critical difference between these two is that in Connextâ€™s version, the [natspec documentation](https://github.com/connext/monorepo/blob/4538-wormhole-connector/packages/deployments/contracts/contracts/messaging/interfaces/ambs/wormhole/IWormholeReceiver.sol#L10-L15) of `receiveWormholeMessages()` describes that it will be invoked by a different address than the Wormhole Relayer, while in the official wormhole foundation interface, we can see this is not accurate:
        
        ```solidity
        /**
         * @notice When a `send` is performed with this contract as the target, this function will be
         *     invoked by the WormholeRelayer contract
         *
         * NOTE: This function should be restricted such that only the Wormhole Relayer contract can call it.
        ```
        
        Consider updating it to be consistent with the source bridge implementation.

        ## [Q-2] Encoded gas limit higher than `gasCap` revert is unclear

        In `BaseWormhole.sol`, if the `_encodedData` gas forwarder to `_sendMessage()` is higher than the gas limit set in `GasCap`, the logic will cap and reassign this value as the `gasCap`. 
        
        ```solidity
        //calculate cost to deliver message
        uint256 gasLimit = _getGasFromEncoded(_encodedData);
        
        ...
        
        /**
         * @notice Using Wormhole relayer (AMB), the gas is provided to `sendMessage` as an encoded uint
         */
        function _getGasFromEncoded(bytes memory _encodedData) internal view returns (uint256 _gas) {
          // Should include gssas info in specialized calldata
          require(_encodedData.length == 32, "!encoded data length");
        
          // Get the gas, if it is more than the cap use the cap
          _gas = _getGas(abi.decode(_encodedData, (uint256)));
        }
        ```
        
        However, since the `msg.value` is required to be equal to the `deliveryCost`, and in the public `quoteEVMDeliveryPrice` the `_gasLimit` is not being capped, the final `deliveryCost` in quoted in `_sendMessage` could change after the `_gasLimit` is capped.
        
        Consider capping the gas limit in the public `quoteEVMDeliveryPrice` or requiring that the gas limit in `_encodedData` is `=<` than `gasCap`.

        ## [Q-3] `renounceOwnership` logic is not consistent across contracts

        In the Connext-2 audit, [the fix for issue Q-13](https://github.com/connext/monorepo/pull/4034/commits/85da8edf4b69ce915a24ff2abdec301ef9c4f48a) changed the implementation of `renounceOwnership()` to revert and return an error when called instead of succeeding without any change. Consider doing the same for `renounceOwnership()` in the `WormholeSpokeConnector` contract.

        `processedWhMessages` of the `BaseWormhole` is different. While the `processedMessages` of other connectors means if the `connext` processed message, but `processedWhMessages`  is to prevent replaying of wormhole relaying separately.

        ## [Q-4] Use consistent naming across contracts for replay protection data variable

        In `BaseWormhole` data variable for keeping status of processed messages is named `processedWhMessages`. However, in `ArbitrumHubConnector`, `OptimismHubConnector`, and `ZkSyncHubConnector`, this variable is named `processed`.

        ```markdown
        mapping(bytes32 => bool) public processedWhMessages;
        ```

        Consider renaming `processedWhMessages` to `processed` for consistency.
