      ## [I-1] Missing functionality for allowing BorrowerActions to call rejectNewTerms() for a fixed-term loan
  
      In the `MapleLoan` contract of the fixed-term-loan repository, `BorrowerActions` actor has been added to act on behalf of the borrower. However, `rejectNewTerms()` has not been updated, and the necessary functionality to allow the `BorrowerActions` actor to execute this operation is missing. Since the `MapleBorrowerActions` contract does not yet support this functionality, it does not introduce any issues. However, for consistency, it should follow a similar logic from the open-term `MapleLoan` contract.
