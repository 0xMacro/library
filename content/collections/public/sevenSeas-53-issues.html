        ## Security Analysis

        ### TAC CrossChainLayer bridge
        
        - General
            - Documentation: No available documentation
            - A bridging protocol on the TAC chain, allowing bridging to and from the TON network
            - Main components are:
                - Cross Chain Layer: Contract that allows sending and receiving messages to and from TON.
        - Security Evaluation
            - Audited by Trail of Bits
          
            
            Although it is a fairly standard bridging contract, it is upgradeable and is setup to allow for additional message types in future upgrades. It has minimal owner priviledged functions allowing a protocol fee to be set, a tokenUtils contract to be initialized, and protocol fees to be withdrawn, all fairly standard functions where the only concern would be a unexpected raise to the protocol fee, or a malicious upgrade that could steal locked assets. The owner is [currently a 2:2 safe](https://explorer.tac.build/address/0x592e0D5f382E83406eADC6532a559A457aae7d3b?tab=contract_code) contract without a timelock, which is better than an EOA, but should be watched for malicious activity before interacting with the bridge.
            
            This has been audited by a notable and trusted auditing firm, Trail of Bits, and all issues found have been resolved, giving confidence that there are no lingering issues.
            
            It also should be noted that interacting with bridges requires trust that a call on the destination chain are made as expected, so interacting with bridges in general has some inherent risk.
            
        
        Rating: C (Upgradeable with semi-secure ownership, bridge protocols are inherently risky and require outside trust)
        
        ### TAC intermediate USDT bridging contracts on TON
        
        - General
            - Documentation: No available documentation
            - An intermediate bridging protocol on the TON chain, intended to be used to bride USDT from TAC to ETH or ETH to TAC by first receiving a bridge request and forwarding USDT to the appropriate chain using Layer 0 when interacting with ETH mainnet and the Cross Chain Layer when interacting with TAC.
            - Main components are:
                - ETH USDT Treasury: Contract that sends USDT received to ETH mainnet via layer 0.
                - TAC USDT Treasury: Contract that sends USDT received to TAC via the cross chain layer bridge
        - Security Evaluation
            - Audited by Quantstamp
            - Contracts:
                - [**tac_usdt_treasury**](https://github.com/TacBuild/lz-bridge/blob/main/treasury_contracts/contracts/tac_usdt_treasury.fc)
                - [**eth_usdt_treasury**](https://github.com/TacBuild/lz-bridge/blob/main/treasury_contracts/contracts/eth_usdt_treasury.fc)
            
            Straight forward bridging forwarder contract. Notably the 3 issues found by Quantstamp have not been resolved but they are minor and should net effect user interactions.
            
        
        Rating: B (bridge protocols are inherently risky and require outside trust)

    <p>Specifically, we conducted a security review based the following TAC and TON contracts:</p>
