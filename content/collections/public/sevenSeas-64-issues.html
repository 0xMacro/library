    ## [I-1] New behavior for `denyFrom`

    The `denyFrom` field in the `BeforeTransferData` struct gained an additional meaning with the proposed changes:

    - Before, it meant "prevent this address from transferring shares".
    - Now, it has an additional meaning of "prevent this address from providing liquidity".

    According to the development team, this is intended.

    No vulnerabilities are introduced with this change.
