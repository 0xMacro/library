      ## [M-1] Oracle stops functioning when `navs` gets smaller

  
      In the `SuperstateOracle`, the `calculateRealtimeNavs()` function determines the correct oracle price at a particular time based on linear extrapolation of prices from the last two effective checkpoints.
  
      ```solidity
      function calculateRealtimeNavs(
          uint128 targetTimestamp,
          uint128 earlierCheckpointNavs,
          uint128 earlierCheckpointTimestamp,
          uint128 laterCheckpointNavs,
          uint128 laterCheckpointTimestamp
      ) public pure returns (uint128 answer) {
          answer = laterCheckpointNavs
              + ((laterCheckpointNavs - earlierCheckpointNavs) * (targetTimestamp - laterCheckpointTimestamp))
                  / (laterCheckpointTimestamp - earlierCheckpointTimestamp);
      }
      ```
  
      However, implementation incorrectly assumes that the later checkpoint **will always have** a `navs` value higher than the earlier checkpoint. While this would be the case in most situations, there is a non-zero probability that `navs` may be reduced. In this scenario, the price oracle will stop functioning as `calculateRealtimeNavs()` would revert due to an underflow error.
  
      **Remediations to consider**
  
      - Update `calculateRealtimeNavs()` implementation to properly handle case when `navs` is reduced.

      ## [M-2] Use SafeERC20.forceApprove() in liquidate()

  
      In the `MorphoLiquidationV1` contract, the `liquidate()` function includes approving the max amount of `loanToken` to the `morpho` contract for performing the corresponding liquidation. The regular `approve()` method is used in the implementation, which is adequate for most ERC20 implementations.
  
      ```solidity
      uint256 balanceLoanToken = IERC20(marketParams.loanToken).balanceOf({account: address(this)});
      if (balanceLoanToken == 0) revert InsufficientLoanTokenBalance();
      IERC20(marketParams.loanToken).approve({spender: address(morpho), value: type(uint256).max});
      ```
  
      However, `USDT`, a popular stablecoin ERC20, will revert the `approve()` if the spender's previous approved balance is non-zero. See the snippet below ([source](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code)).
  
      ```solidity
      /**
      * @dev Approve the passed address to spend the specified amount of tokens on behalf of msg.sender.
      * @param _spender The address which will spend the funds.
      * @param _value The amount of tokens to be spent.
      */
      function approve(address _spender, uint _value) public onlyPayloadSize(2 * 32) {
  
          // To change the approve amount you first have to reduce the addresses`
          //  allowance to zero by calling `approve(_spender, 0)` if it is not
          //  already 0 to mitigate the race condition described here:
          //  https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729
          require(!((_value != 0) && (allowed[msg.sender][_spender] != 0)));
  
          allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
          Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
      }
      ```
  
      As a result, the above implementation would not be appropriate for `USDT` when it is being used as a `loanToken` or for any other token that follows a similar implementation approach.
  
      **Remediations to consider**
  
      - Replace `approve()` with `forceApprove()` from the `SafeERC20` lib, which correctly handles this edge case.

      ## [M-3] Deploy scripts have incorrect caller
  
      In the `DeployAndUpgradeUstbScriptV2` and `DeployAndUpgradeUsccScriptV2` upgrade scripts, the upgrade procedure involves calling methods on other contracts that contain authorization checks.
  
      In the current implementation, the implicit assumption is that the deployer (executor of deploy scripts) is the same as an authorized party in called contracts, such as admin/owner in USTB and USCC contracts.
  
      However, this is not the case in mainnet contracts, and as a result, scripts are not directly executable.
  
      **Remediations to consider**
  
      - Update upgrade scripts to execute upgrade operations with proper permissions, or
      - Use alternative methods based on the current infrastructure for managing authorizations.

      ## [L-1] Missing validation for `navs` value change
  
      In the `SuperstateOracle`, `_addCheckpoint()` function contains multiple input validation constraints that enforce proper values set. One of these validates that the new `navs` value is never smaller than the `MINIMUM_ACCEPTABLE_PRICE`.
  
      However, there is no corresponding validation that enforces that the provided `navs` value is not unexpectedly large, which would impact all downstream systems using this oracle.
  
      **Remediations to consider**
  
      - Add validation for provided `navs` to never have a balance change greater than `MAX_NAVS_CHANGE`.

      ## [L-2] Reset loanToken approval after `liquidate()`

  
      In the `MorphoLiquidationV1` contract, the `liquidate()` function includes approving the max amount of `loanToken` to the `morpho` contract for performing the corresponding liquidation. When `liquidate()` is successfully processed, the `morpho` contract will still be authorized to spend almost the whole `MorphoLiquidationV1`'s loanToken balance.
  
      In case of an unexpected `morpho` contract compromise, this would put at risk all `loanToken` balances of the `MorphoLiquidationV1` contract.
  
      **Remediations to consider**
  
      - Reset `morpho` approval to 0 for `loanToken` after liquidation is performed.

      ## [Q-1] The `tokenProxy` variable in the deploy scripts is unnecessary
  
  
      In the `DeployAndUpgradeUsccScriptV2` and `DeployAndUpgradeUstbScriptV2` contracts, thereâ€™s a `tokenProxy` variable declared with the `TransparentUpgradeableProxy` type, which is later used by being wrapped in the `address` type.

      ## [Q-5] MorphoLiquidationV1.liquidate() natspec is incorrect

  
      In the `MorphoLiquidationV1` contract, the natspec documentation for `liquidate()` is incorrect.
  
      1. It is missing `param` description for the `morphoMarketId` argument
      2. It contains a `dev` comment, which does not apply to this implementation since it doesn't use the callback feature.
      
          ```solidity
          @dev The function uses callbacks, so the sender doesn't need to hold tokens to perform this operation
          ```
      
  
      Consider updating natspec documentation for `liquidate()` to describe the current implementation properly.
