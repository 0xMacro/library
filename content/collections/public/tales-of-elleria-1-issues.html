      ## [H-1] Hero owner may reset Hero properties

      In the `EllerianHeroUpgradeable` contract, `SynchronizeHero()` function may be invoked multiple times with the same signature to reset `Hero` related attributes to previously valid but currently obsolete data.
  
      `VerifySignature` contract documentation indicates that its verification functions, such as `bigVerify()` on which `SynchronizeHero()` relies, do not have replay attack protection and that any logic reliant must also have logic guarding against replay attacks.
  
      However, `SynchronizeHero()` does not follow this guideline and therefore is vulnerable to replay attack.
  
      **Remediations to Consider:**
  
      - Implement replay attack protection similar to how it is implemented in `ElleriaElmBridge:RetrieveElleriumFromGame()` using a nonce as part of the signed message.

      ## [M-1] Incorrect output of checkTotalRewards() function
  
      In the `ElleriumLPStakingPool` contract, `rewardRate` value is denominated in Gwei. In addition, `setRewardRate()`, the function for updating `rewardRate` expects input denominated in Gwei `_emissionRateInGWEI`. Also, in `getReward()` function `totalRewards[msg.sender]` is multiplied by `1e9` to get the actual reward amount in Wei.
  
      ```solidity
      function getReward() public nonReentrant updateReward(msg.sender) {
          uint256 reward = totalRewards[msg.sender] * 1e9;
          if (reward > 0) {
              totalRewards[msg.sender] = 0;
  
              rewardsToken.mint(msg.sender, reward);
              emit ClaimedReward(msg.sender, reward);
          }
      }
      ```
  
      However, the implementation of the `checkTotalRewards()` function does not have corresponding multiplication by the `1e9` factor, even though the natspec comment indicates that the return value is denominated in Wei.
  
      ```solidity
      /// @notice Exposes sender's claimable rewardToken balance.
      /// @return Sender's Claimable rewardToken balance in WEI.
      function checkTotalRewards() external view returns (uint256) {
          return totalRewards[msg.sender];
      }
      ```
  
      **Remediations to Consider:**
  
      - Update `checkTotalRewards()` so it returns the `totalRewards` amount for a particular user denominated in Wei instead of Gwei, or
      - Change `rewardRate` to be expressed in Wei instead of Gwei. Correspondingly, update `setRewardRate()` and `getReward()` function implementations to work with Wei denomination to prevent accidental issuance of enormous rewards which could happen at the moment if `setRewardRate()` is called with an emission rate incorrectly provided in Wei.

      ## [M-2] Contract dependencies are not immutable
  
      In the `ElleriumLPStakingPool` and `ElleriaElmBridge` contracts, `setAddresses()` and `SetReferences()` functions can be called only by the contract owner. These two functions are responsible for initializing and updating important external contract dependencies, which include staking token, rewards token, staking fee, and signature verification contract.
  
      If these contract dependencies are not properly set or they get accidentally misconfigured, overall system operation will be affected. In addition, the two previously mentioned contracts cannot be properly used after deployment without a call to these functions.
  
      To increase user trust in the overall system, it is important to provide means for users to verify important state changes and to react in case they disagree with the same. Also, it is best practice to minimize important system configuration updates, such as updates to external dependencies, unless they are necessary.
  
      **Remediations to consider:**
  
      - Set contract dependencies in the contract constructor during contract deploy, and
      - In case contract dependencies updates are required, add a timelock mechanism with appropriate delay when contract dependency updates are performed in an existing system.
    </field>

      ## [M-3] Contract owner has excessive privileges for managing token assets
  
      In the `ElleriumLPStakingPool` and `ElleriaElmBridge` contracts, the `withdrawToken()` function, which is callable only by the owner, enables the caller to withdraw all ERC20 assets from the contract.
  
      ```solidity
      function withdrawToken(address _tokenContract, uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {
        IERC20 tokenContract = IERC20(_tokenContract);
        tokenContract.transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
      }
      ```
  
      While this functionality may serve a purpose in an emergency situation, its presence in its current form may affect users’ trust in the overall system.
  
      **Remediations to Consider:**
  
      - Consider removing `withdrawToken()` from the `ElleriaElmBridge` since `ElleriaElmBridge` does not store ELM assets but burns them during `BridgeElleriumIntoGame()` operation.
      - Consider replacing `withdrawToken()` in `ElleriumLPStakingPool` with functionality for individual users to perform an emergency withdrawal in case an emergency state is enabled.
    </field>
    <field name="response">
        Resolutiom: withdrawToken() removed from both contracts.

        The contract ElleriaElmBridge does not manage ERC20 tokens, hence there was no risk of funds within the contract being mismanaged.

        ElleriumLPStakingPool, the intent was to withdraw stuck tokens, though makes sense it can cause trust issues.

        The "emergency state" is essentially RewardRate set to 0 and feesTaken set to false.

      ## [L-4] Signature replay using hash collision
  
      In the `EllerianHeroUpgradeable` contract, `SynchronizeHero()` function implementation relies on a fixed set of elements (11) from provided `_data` array argument. This `_data` argument is also forwarded to `VerifySignature:bigVerify()` function which iterates through `_data` elements and calculates message hash for signature verification.
  
      However, since the `_data` array can be of a length that is greater than the necessary set of elements, the malicious caller of `SynchronizeHero()` can add extra elements to the `_data` array to generate a hash collision.

      ## [L-6] Non-standard ERC20 burn implementation
  
      In the `ElleriumTokenERC20v2` contract, the internal `_transfer()` function is meant to handle the transfer to 0 address as a burn operation. When recipient is address(0), `totalSupply` is reduced by the provided amount of token.

      However, what differs from expected behavior is that `_balance` of address(0) will still get increased by the provided amount. This not be the case since it invalidates the invariant that the sum of individual account balances should be equal to the `totalSupply`.

      ## [L-7] Incorrect Transfer event data
    
      In the `ElleriumTokenERC20v2` contract, the internal `_transfer()` function performs token transfer with additional logic to prevent transfers before the system is completely configured. One aspect of this mechanism is that those who attempt transfers beforehand will get blacklisted. A consequence of getting blacklisted is that transfers from the blacklisted address will be rerouted to the owner-controlled address.
  
      When a transfer from the blacklisted address is processed, corresponding balances are updated. However, Transfer event emission references the initial `recipient` instead of `actualRecipient` which in this edge case is incorrect.
  
      ```solidity
      ...
      _balances[actualRecipient] = _balances[actualRecipient] + amount;
      emit Transfer(sender, recipient, amount);
      ```

      ## [G-2] Prefer `+=` instead of `+` since it costs less gas
  
      When updating a value in an array with arithmetic, using `array[index] += amount` is cheaper than `array[index] = array[index] + amount`. This is because you avoid an additional `mload` when the array is stored in memory and a `sload` when the array is stored in storage.
  
      This can be applied for any arithmetic operation including `+=`, `-=`,`/=`,`*=`,`^=`,`&=`, `%=`, `<<=`,`>>=`, and `>>>=`. This optimization can be particularly significant if the pattern occurs during a loop.
