        ## [M-1] `swapCompact` not working with `addressList`

The `OdosDecoderAndSanitizer` implements the `swapCompact` function that provides a gas-efficient way of swapping. One way to reduce the `calldata` size is to cache addresses in an `addressList`, allowing users to specify only the ID instead of the entire address. However, in `swapCompact`, the logic to mark addresses fails and breaks the decoder. 

For addresses that need to be fetched from the addressList, assembly is used to store a marker as follows:

```jsx
  default {
      // Store a marker in the high bits and the index in the low bits
      // We'll use this later to know we need to look up from addressList
      result := or(0x1000000000000000000000000000000000000000, sub(inputPos, 2))
      newPos := add(currPos, 2)
  }
```

Subsequently, it is checked via `isAddressMarked` if a marker is set and whether an address needs to be fetched:

```jsx
function isAddressMarked(address addr) private pure returns (bool) {
    return uint256(uint160(addr)) >= 2**160;
}
```

**Reference**: [OdosDecoderAndSanitizer.sol#L55](https://github.com/Veda-Labs/boring-vault/blob/080322f15d61fe0b35b960384ac918723a2a7f7f/src/base/DecodersAndSanitizers/Protocols/OdosDecoderAndSanitizer.sol#L55)

The marker is stored at `0x1000000000000000000000000000000000000000` which is the equivalent to `2**156`. However, `isAddressMarked` checks against `≥ 2**160`. Consequently, marked addresses will never be fetched from the `addressList,` breaking the integration to the protocol. 

**Remediation to Consider**

Change the way how relevant addresses are being marked. One possible solution is to simply use a `mapping(address→bool)` to store addresses that need to be fetched from the `addressList`. </field>
