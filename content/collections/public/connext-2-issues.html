        ## [H-1] RootManager.propagate susceptible to DoS
        
        In the RootManager contract, `propagate()` function is responsible for distributing aggregate roots to all connectors for corresponding domains. Implementation of this function does not revert when interaction with a specific connector fails. This prevents a single inaccessible chain from causing a complete system halt. Particular functionality was introduced to fix a previously reported issue in Spearbit audit https://github.com/spearbit-audits/connext-nxtp/issues/34.
        
        When `propagate()` is called, a set of initial validation checks is performed. If these checks are successful `lastPropagatedRoot` value will be set in `_sendRootToHubs()`. In the rest of `propagate()` function, even if interaction with all connectors fails, `propagate()` function will not revert. In this case, the `lastPropagatedRoot` value will remain set. This means that follow-up invocations of `propagate()` function will not be possible until `_aggregateRoot` is updated. This is indeed the original intention of this code.
        
        ```solidity
        // Sanity check: make sure we are not propagating a redundant aggregate root.
        require(_aggregateRoot != lastPropagatedRoot, "redundant root");
        lastPropagatedRoot = _aggregateRoot;
        ```
        
        However, `propagate()` function can be invoked by anyone. Since it doesn’t have any access control limits. As a result, a malicious actor can invoke this function with inappropriate arguments. For example, by providing encoding data of unexpected length. This will cause most, if not all, connectors to revert when invoked. For example, processing will fail for:
        
        - PolygonHubConnector in `_sendMessage()` function when `encodedData.length` is not 0
        - ZKSyncHubConnector when `encodedData.length` is not 32
        - BaseMultichain in `_sendMessage()` when `encodedData.length` is not 0
        - GnosisBase in `_getGasFromEncoded()` when `encodedData.length` is not 32
        - ArbitrumHubConnector in `_sendMessage()` when `encodedData.length` is not 96
        
        As a result of malicious actor actions, aggregate roots won’t be propagated to destination domains. The system may recover if a new root is added and `propagate()` is called with proper inputs. However, an attacker may front-run these calls with their own invocation with adverse inputs.
        
        **Remediations to Consider:**
        
        1. Implement per domain check and take into account that the same scenario is possible due to the reset of `finalizedOptimisticAggregateRoot` variable in `_optimisticPropagate()` and `_slowPropagate()` functions, or
        2. Restrict access to `propagate()` and `finalizeAndPropagate()` function to relayers only.

        ## [H-2] Trust model affected when `addBypass()` is enabled to be bypassable
        
        The `Conductor` contract serves as an upgrade timelock for the messaging layer; it enables the owner to queue transactions and execute them after a delay period. Additionally, the `addBypass`/`removeBypass` functions can be utilized to skip the execution delay for a specific `_target` and `_selector`. These bypass whitelisted functions must undergo the same queue and delay period before their addition.
        
        However, the `addBypass` function allows the owner to execute any arbitrary function call without queueing and waiting for the corresponding delay by:
        
        - Queue and execute (after `delay()`) the `addBypass` function using the `addBypass.selector` and `address` of the conductor as `_target`.
        - Assemble and `executeWithBypass` a transaction array with:
            - `addBypass(anyTarget, anySelector)`
            - `anyTarget.anySelector()`
        
        Since the logic checks if the target/selector is bypassed and executes it in order, the owner can add any `_target` and `_selector` atomically in one `executeWithBypass` call.
        
        **Remediations to Consider:**
        
        - Disallowing the address of the conductor as `_target` in `addBypass`.

        ## [H-3] `directSwapperCall` allows arbitrary calls to any contract
        
        `SwapAdapter` is a shared contract that allows swapping assets by implementing adapters for each exchange that can be used both in the origin and destination chain.
        
        However, in the `directSwapperCall` function, there are no checks on whether the `_swapper` address is a swapper implementation. Allowing anyone to execute **any** arbitrary call on **any** address with the contract’s context. Although the contracts are not intended to hold any assets, any future integration implementation built on top of `SwapAdapter` contract will inherit this dangerous function, essentially acting as a public backdoor entry point.
        
        **Remediations to Consider:**
        
        - Consider restricting `_swapper` parameter value to entries in the `allowedSwappers` mapping.

        In SwapAdapter.sol, `exactSwap()` function calls with `_fromAsset` equal to `address(0)` will perform the specific logic for native asset in the intended Swapper contract, `swapETH()`:
        
        ```solidity
        function exactSwap(
          address _swapper,
          uint256 _amountIn,

          bytes calldata _swapData // comes directly from API with swap data encoded
        ) external payable returns (uint256 amountOut) {
          ...
        
          if (_fromAsset == address(0)) {
            amountOut = ISwapper(_swapper).swapETH(_amountIn, _toAsset, _swapData);

        }

        ## [H-8] `OneInchUniswapV3` incorrect `swapETH` implementation
        
        In the `OneInchUniswapV3` swapper contract, the `swapETH()` function is incorrectly implemented and is not consistent with the other swapper implementations that use `WETH` as an intermediate swap for native assets. The `oneInchUniRouter.uniswapV3Swap()` call (line 102) does not send any value to the call. Another point to take into account is that the [uniswapV3Swap() function](https://docs.1inch.io/docs/aggregation-protocol/smart-contract/UnoswapV3Router/#uniswapv3swap) is not payable and therefore doesn’t accept ETH transfers.

        - Implementing `WETH9` as an intermediate swap, similar to the other swapper contracts or,

        ## [M-1] Incomplete cooldown feature for proposing aggregate root
        
        The `RelayerProxyHub` contract contains functionality meant to prevent more frequent invocation of `proposeAggregateRoot()`. This is based on using `lastProposeAggregateRootAt` and `proposeAggregateRootCooldown` variables.
        
        However, this functionality does not work since:
        
        1. `proposeAggregateRootCooldown` is never set, and there are no means to update it
        2. `lastProposeAggregateRootAt` is never set
        3. corresponding `AggregateRootCooldownChanged` event is missing, which is necessary to have consistent implementation
        
        As a result, relayers are able to propose aggregate roots with any frequency without restriction.
        
        **Remediations to Consider:**
        
        1. Update `RelayerProxyHub` contract functionality to have proper cooldown functionality for proposing aggregate root, or
        2. Remove this functionality if it is unnecessary

        ## [M-4] Native assets sent to `swapAndXCall()` may get lost

        The `SwapAndXCall` contract implements two `swapAndXCall()` functions, one which pays the relayer fee in the native asset and the second one that uses the output asset to pay for the relayer fee. However, both of these functions are payable. If users mistakenly send native assets to the `swapAndXCall()` function with the `_relayerFee` argument, these funds will get stuck in the contract.
        
        Following edge case scenarios are not correctly handled when a variant of `swapAndXCall()` with `_relayerFee` is invoked:
        
        1. `_fromAsset == address(0)` and `msg.value` is greater than `amountIn`. In this case, the amount of native assets equal to the difference of `msg.value` and `amountIn` will remain stuck in the contract.
        2. `fromAsset` is a non-zero address and `msg.value` is also non-zero. In this case, the amount of native assets equal to the `msg.value` will remain stuck in the contract. 
        
        **Remediations to Consider:**
        
        - Removing the payable modifier for the `swapAndXCall()` function that uses the output asset for paying the relayer fee, or
        - Splitting the internal `_setupAndSwap()` function into two separate functions to appropriately handle edge cases for each higher-level variant of the `swapAndXCall()`.

        ## [M-5] Unsafe transfer of ERC20 tokens
        
        In `ForwarderXReceiver` and `AuthForwarderXReceiver` contracts, `xReceive()` function implementation contains an identical piece of code that handles the fallback case when a transfer of ERC20 tokens to provided target has failed.
        
        ```solidity
        if (!successfulForward) {
          IERC20(_asset).transfer(_fallbackAddress, _amount);

        These contracts are supposed to handle generic ERC20 tokens, some of which do not follow ERC20 conventions with respect to how they report transfer failure. Some revert, as specified by the standard, but others return false.
        
        As a result, mentioned implementation is unsafe since potentially some transfer failures will be considered successful even when they are not. In these cases, assets will remain in the custody of a particular contract instead of being transferred to the `_fallbackAddress`.

        ## [M-8] Default deadline value of the `block.timestamp` allows pending transactions to be maliciously executed
        
        In the `UniV2Swapper` and `UniV3Swapper` contracts, `swap()` and `swapETH()` functions feature calls to `uniswapV2Router` and `uniswapV3Router` with deadline/expiration parameter hardcoded to `block.timestamp` value. These functions do not allow users to configure a deadline for their underlying swaps on UniswapV2 and UniswapV3. As a consequence, this missing feature enables pending transactions to be maliciously executed at a later point.
        
        Hardcoded deadline value of `block.timestamp` makes it possible for the transaction to be executed long after its expected execution time. For example, it may remain in the mempool for extended periods until it becomes interesting for block builders to include it. Also, it can be intentionally delayed to extract the maximum slippage value.
        
        UniswapV2 and UniswapV3 offer deadline/expiration parameters in their functions as a protection mechanism. Hardcoding these parameters to `block.timestamp` circumvents this protection mechanism and makes this integration layer built upon UniswapV2 and UniswapV3 less secure for end users.
        
        **Remediations to Consider:**
        
        - Introduce a configurable `deadline` parameter to all functions which perform a swap on the user's behalf, such as `swap()` and `swapETH()`.

        In `AuthForwarderXReceiver`, `constructor()` and `addOrigin()` do not perform any checks on whether the `_originDomain` to be added is already in the `originDomains` array. This can cause an origin to be in the array multiple times.
        
        In order to remove a duplicated domain and rectify an invalid state, the function `removeOrigin` would need to be called multiple times since the logic will only delete one value per call.
        
        **Remediations to Consider:**
        
        - Consider checking whether the `originRegistry[_originDomain]` is already set and reverting if that is the case. Otherwise, add a new origin.

        ## [L-4] Allowance check in `_setupAndSwap()` references incorrect variable
        
        In the `SwapAndXCall` contract, function `_setupAndSwap()` contains an allowance check which, if satisfied, approves the max amount of `_toAsset` tokens to the `connext` contract.
        
        ```solidity
        if (IERC20(_toAsset).allowance(address(this), address(connext)) < _amountIn) {
          IERC20(_toAsset).approve(address(connext), type(uint256).max);
        }
        ```
        
        However, this check incorrectly references `_amountIn` instead of the `amountOut` variable, which represents the amount of `_toAsset` that `connext` uses in subsequent `xcall()` operations.
        
        In a situation when the current `connext` allowance for `_toAsset` is greater or equal to `_amountIn` but less than `amountOut`, this may result in unexpected operation processing failure.
        
        **Remediations to Consider:**
        
        - Update particular allowance check to reference the correct variable, which is `amountOut` instead of `_amountIn`.

        ## [L-5] Queued transactions do not have an expiry date for execution
        
        The `Conductor` contract timelock functionality can potentially be bypassed by queueing multiple transactions on deployment. Since there is no time limit on when these could be executed, the owner can add any arbitrary number of calls, wait for the `delay()`, and execute them at any given moment after the delay.
        
        **Remediations to Consider:**
        
        - Consider adding an expiry check date to execute queued transactions (e.g. `X` weeks/days after the `delay`).

        ## [L-6] ZkSync `l2GasPerPubdataByteLimit` is hardcoded
        
        The `l2GasPerPubdataByteLimit` is a parameter that contains the L2 gas price per each published to L1 calldata byte. In the current `ZkSyncHubConnector` implementation, it’s hardcoded in the `_sendMessage` logic function:
        
        ```solidity
        // The maximum amount L2 gas that the operator may charge the user for.
        uint256 l2GasPerPubdataByteLimit = 800;
        ```
        
        However, [ZkSync's recommendation](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-contracts/blob/main/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/Mailbox.sol#L221-L226) regarding this parameter is that this constant shouldn’t be relied on to be fixed and that every contract should provide the ability to supply the `_l2GasPerPubdataByteLimit` for each independent transaction. 
        
        **Remediations to Consider:**
        
        - Consider providing the `_l2GasPerPubdataByteLimit` on the client side and using it in the function parameters.
