        ## [I-1] Ownable implementation without admin functions

        Although the contract inherits and implements `Ownable.sol` from OpenZeppelin, no functions are gated through the `onlyModifier`. 
        As a result, the `owner` address is unable to modify any particular setting or take privileged actions inside the contract.

        ## [I-2] Additional view functions

        Since the code was generated using a token generator tool, the contract implements additional view functions, `generator()` and `version()` that do not
        serve any specific use case or purpose within the ERC20 token standard or the Bitcone community.

        ## [I-2] Max supply is fixed

        The maximum and current supply of the Bitcone token cannot be altered in any way. 
        This value was set during the contract deployment construction and there are no public or external functions that allow for its modification.
