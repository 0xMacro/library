        ## [M-1] Incorrect sanitization of destination chain

        The assembly blocks in both the merkle tree generation and the decoder's `depositAndBridge` function aim to convert a `uint32` value from a `bytes` array to an `address` type. However, due to the final right shift operation (`shr(96, word)`), the conversion always returns `0x0` for the chain ID. The test appears to pass only because both functions return `0x0` for the address, meaning the sanitization is ineffective and allows any chain ID to be passed. 
        
        **Remediation to Consider**
        
        Remove the right shift operation from the assembly blocks to preserve the actual converted value.

        ## [L-1] Mellow decoder doesnâ€™t sanitize the deposit token

        In Mellow's [deposit function](https://github.com/Veda-Labs/boring-vault/pull/251/files#diff-e2a9ee842351c79873643646c5c510da1355cd6b49d7ecac8bb4ac86beebc63aR20), the parameter `amounts` determines which underlying vault tokens are being deposited based on their index in the array. While currently only `WETH` and `wstETH` tokens are supported, protocol admins can add additional tokens through the Vault's `addToken` function. To maintain control over which tokens can be deposited, the boring vault needs to sanitize the underlying tokens based on their index in the `amounts` array.
        The likelihood of this issue is low since token deposits are additionally restricted by token approvals. 

        **Remediation to Consider**
        
        Retrieve the vault's underlying tokens through the `underlyingTokens()` function and sanitize them according to their corresponding positions in the `amounts` array.

        ## [L-2] `preDeposits` can be passed in `adjustDenVault`

        In the Beraborrow decoder's `openDenVault` function, passing `preDeposit` is explicitly disallowed by this check:
        
        ```solidity
        if (params._preDeposit.length > 0) revert BeraborrowDecoderAndSanitizer__PredepositLengthGtZero(); 
        ```
        
        However, the `adjustDenVault` function lacks this check, which allows values to be passed to the `_preDeposit` parameter. This could enable deposits of assets not explicitly allowed by the boring vault.
        
        **Remediation to Consider**
        
        Add the above check to the `adjustDenVault` function.
