      ## [Q-1] Incorrect natspec for _authorizeUpgrade()
  
      In the `Management` contract, natspec comment indicates that caller with UPGRADER_ROLE is the expected caller and only actor that will be authorized to perform `_authorizeUpgrade()` call.
  
      ```solidity
      /// @dev Allows only the UPGRADER_ROLE to upgrade the contract
      function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) internal override onlyOwner {}
      ```
  
      However, `Management` contract does not implement role based access control, and in fact only the contract owner is the actor who can authorize upgrade.
  
      Consider updating natspec comment to align with the implementation, or update implementation to be in line with the expressed intent in the natspec documentation.

      ## [Q-2] Use named mapping arguments

      In the `Management` contract, state of the contract is represent by the `ManagementStorage` struct
  
      ```solidity
      /// @custom:storage-location erc7201:savea.storage.Management
      struct ManagementStorage {
          /// @notice Mapping to store settings
          mapping(uint256 => uint256) settings;
          /// @notice Mapping to store supported NFT contracts
          mapping(address => bool) supportedNFTContracts;
          /// @notice Mapping to store paidAt made by wallets
          mapping(address => uint256) paidAt;
          /// @notice Mapping to store redemptions made by wallets
          mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => DataTypes.Redemption)) redemptions;
          ...
      }
      ```
  
      Consider using named mapping arguments for better code readability.
