        ## [C-1] Seaport’s success check can permanently fail making the entire “collateral sale” functionality unusable
        
        In `SeaportBasicRoute.sol::_checkSuccess`, the following check is made when ERC20 tokens are received from OpenSea call:
        
        ```solidity
        } else if (oType >= 4) {
                // Receiving ERC20
                if (
                    IERC20(basicOrderParams.offerToken).balanceOf(address(this)) !=  
                    (basicOrderParams.offerAmount - recipientsTotal)
                ) {
                    revert OR_CallFailed(returnData);
                }
        }
        ```
        
        The transaction reverts if the balance of the contract doesn’t match with *offerAmount - recipientsTotal*. This can be exploited by a malicious user that sends an arbitrary amount of the respective ERC20 tokens directly to the contract’s address.
        
        **Remediations to Consider**
        
        Consider reverting only if contract doesn’t hold sufficient balance.
        
        ```solidity
        if (
            IERC20(basicOrderParams.offerToken).balanceOf(address(this)) <
            (basicOrderParams.offerAmount - recipientsTotal)
        ) {
            revert OR_CallFailed(returnData);
        }
        ```

        ## [C-2] “Collateral sale” doesn’t handle ERC1155 assets correctly

        In`CollateralSaleSeaportBasic.sol::fulfillCollateralSale(..)`, one can specify an ERC1155 token with specific amount as the vault item. However, the specific amount considered for the collateral sale is not taken into account when withdrawing the assets in `CollateralSale.sol::_withdrawAssets`:

        ```solidity
        ...
        else if (vaultItems[i].vaultItemType == LendingPlusLibrary.VaultItemType.ERC1155) {
            // send back 1155's to the seller
            assetVault.withdrawERC1155(vaultItems[i].tokenAddress, vaultItems[i].tokenId, recipient);
        ```

        Instead of the specific consideration amount, the full amount of ERC1155 held by the vault is withdrawn to the contract’s address, but only the consideration amount is sold via OpenSea. As a consequence, the remaining amount of ERC1155 tokens are locked up in the contract. 

        **Remediations to Consider**

        Consider only withdrawing the exact consideration amount to the contract’s address and transfer the remaining amount back to the borrower’s address.

        ## [H-1] Payable currency with transfer tax prevents borrowers from repaying, forcing loan defaults
        
        The repayment functions in `RepaymentCoordinator.sol` and `LoanCore.sol` do not account for transfer tax, which results in less value transferred than requested. Loan payments are first transferred to `RepaymentCoordinator.sol`, then `LoanCore.sol` will re-send to the lender. When transfer tax is enabled on the payment currency, the value received by `RepaymentCoordinator.sol` is less than the expected amount, so the subsequent lender payment fails. As a result, the loan cannot be repaid, and may be forced into default. This costs borrowers any prior loan payments plus collateral.
        
        Malicious ERC20 operators can exploit this by lending and then enabling transfer tax towards the end of an installment loan period. This allows them to recoup most of their capital, as well as claim collateral.
        
        **Remediations to Consider**
        
        Potential options may include:
        
        - Implement a whitelist of supported payable currencies (e.g. no transfer tax implementation; not upgradeable; etc)
        - Allowing borrowers to account for transfer tax in their payments. Note that borrowers will effectively be forced to over-pay the loan in this scenario.
        - Consider adding documentation/guidance regarding the use of transfer-tax currencies.

    </field>
    <field name="response">
        Nonstandard ERC20 token behavior has been previously reported in other audits and public bug bounty programs. We don’t plan to add special-casing for nonstandard tokens in response to this reported issue. In general, given the design of our protocol and the peer-to-peer nature of the mechanism, each counterparty must take care to be aware of the behaviors of the payable currency they are agreeing to, or the collateral they are lending against. Users should always be careful if they receive a loan offer they must originate outside of the Arcade UI, since any tax-on-transfer token will not be supported in our UI product. Therefore this is more of a phishing/social engineering vector as opposed to a core protocol issue, as we currently classify it.
        
        In the future, we plan to eliminate this class of nonstandard behavior issues by implementing an on-chain whitelist for payable currency. At such time we can eliminate more pathways through which a malicious counterparty can use social engineering to trick their counterparty, including the pathway discussed in this report. Until such time as we do this, it is fully the users’ responsibility to ensure they know the terms of their agreement with their counterparty. As suggested in the [M-1] remediation, we’ll work on making this as clear as possible in our documentation.

        ## [H-2] ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens with id > max(int256) cannot be explicitly collateralized for loan origination
        
        `ItemsVerifier.sol` contains logic which restricts the valid range of token ids to [0, `max(int256)`], whereas valid token ids range from [0, `max(uint256)`]. As a result, an asset with token id > `max(int256)` cannot be explicitly collateralized for loan origination. This occurs because the `SignatureItem` struct defines `tokenId` as an `int256` type, in order to treat negative values as wildcard.
        
        **Remediations to Consider**
        
        Consider updating the `tokenId` datatype to `uint256`, and implementing the wildcard option via a new struct value.

        ## [H-3] Lender only receives a small portion of interests for installment loans
        
        `RepaymentController.sol::repayPart` can be called multiple times within the same installment period. Due to the following logic in `InstallmentsCalc::_calcAmountDue`,
        
        ```solidity
        if (numInstallmentsPaid >= _installmentPeriod) {
          // When numInstallmentsPaid is greater than or equal to the _installmentPeriod
          // this indicates that the minimum interest and any late fees for this installment period
          // have already been repaid. Any additional amount sent in this installment period goes to principal
          return (0, 0, 0);
        }
        ```
        
        installment interest only has to be paid on 1st call, for any subsequent calls to `repayPart`, the `_calcAmountDue` function returns `(0, 0, 0)`. 
        
        As a consequence, a borrower can call `repayPart` within 1st installment period and pays down the minimum payment for the first installment. Next, he can call `repayPart` *n* times (*n* stands for the number of installment periods) with amount of only 1 wei, thereby incrementing the `numInstallmentsPaid` variable in `LoanCore::repayPart`, which indicates subsequent installment periods as already paid. When the loan expires, the borrower only has to pay back the principal amount; thus avoiding all further installment interests and late fees that would have otherwise been accrued. 
        
        Consider the following scenario:
        
        1. Installment loan is initialized with: 
            - duration: 1 year, principal: 100 ether, interest 10%, number installments: 10
        2. If borrower always pays in time (and thus no late fees accrue), the lender should receive 110 ethers at the end of the year, incl. the **10 ethers in interest**
        3. However, malicious borrower can do the following during 1st installment period:
            1. Calls `repayPart` with minimum payment of 1 ether
            2. Calls `repayPart` 10 times (as number of installments are 10) with amount of only 1 wei
        4. At the end of the year, borrower only has to pay back the principal amount (minus 9 wei)
        5. As a result, lender **receives only 1 ether** in interest instead of the expected 10 ethers.
        
        Note that in the above scenario, the lender - in addition to loosing interests - can’t claim the collateral after 40% of missed payments, as all installment periods are indicated as paid. 
        
        **Remediations to Consider**
        
        - Don’t allow small repayments, only allow repayments for amount >= `minBalDue` as calculated in `InstallmentsCalc::_calcAmountsDue`
        - or calculate `numInstallmentsPaid` in `LoanCore.repayPart` based on current loan balance

        ## [M-1] An ERC777 payable currency allows malicious lenders to recoup nearly the full loan, then force a default to also take collateral
        
        ERC777 - which implements ERC20 and can be used as a payable currency - makes callbacks to the token receiver upon transfer. The receiver can force a `revert`, causing the transfer to fail. 
        
        If a loan is made with an ERC777 payable currency, the lender can choose whether to deny any repayments (e.g. the final installment) from the borrower, forcing a default and the loss of collateral.
        
        **Remediations to Consider**
        
        Potential options may include:
        
        - Implement a whitelist of supported payable currencies.
        - Upon origination check if the EIP-1820 registry has the payable currency registered as an `ERC777Token` interface implementer. Consider preventing the loan in this scenario.
        - Upon repayment failure check if the EIP-1820 registry has the lender registered as an `ERC777TokensRecipient` interface implementer. Consider pausing the loan in this scenario to allow the lender to remove their registry entry: such that the lender can unpause when the registry entry is removed. Special considerations here may be necessary for:
            - An updated repayment timeline
            - Reasonable outcomes if the loan is never unpaused
        - Update documentation to advise borrowers of these risks (i.e. caveat emptor).

        See response to [H-1] - this issue falls within the same category.

        ## [M-2] Certain approve/transfer functions can be whitelisted, creating trust concerns for users.
        
        The [documentation](https://github.com/arcadexyz/v2-contracts) mentions:
        
        > *Transfer methods are blacklisted in order to prevent backdoor withdrawals from vaults.*
        > 
        
        `CallWhitelist.sol` explicitly blacklists transfer/approval functions for vault assets of type ERC20/ERC721/ERC1155, to create trust with users that these assets cannot be removed from collateralized vaults. However, certain functions are not accounted for in this blacklist:
        
        - `increaseAllowance()` for ERC20.
        - [CryptoPunks](https://etherscan.io/token/0xb47e3cd837ddf8e4c57f05d70ab865de6e193bbb#code) have a unique set of functions to control transfer of ownership:
            - `transferPunk()`
            - `offerPunkForSale()`
            - `offerPunkForSaleToAddress()`
            - `buyPunk()`
        
        This opens the potential that these methods could be whitelisted, which may create trust concerns for Arcade protocol users

        ## [M-4] Malicious borrower can secure an under-collateralized loan for immediate profit

        The logic in `ItemsVerifier.sol` and `PunksVerifier.sol` allows a malicious borrower to request a loan against a Vault with less collateral than indicated within the `SignatureItems` predicate. For example, a Vault may only contain a single BAYC token, but a malicious borrower can falsely indicate two (or many more) wildcard BAYC items as collateral, and the loan will successfully originate upon signing.  Doing this, a malicious borrower can secure an under-collateralized loan, and intentionally default to achieve an immediate profit - at the expense of the actual collateral.
        
        This occurs because `verifyPredicates()` within `ItemsVerifier.sol` and `PunksVerifier.sol` only checks that the Vault contains at least one asset token, without accounting for the possibility of multiple wildcard predicate items for the same asset.  From `ItemsVerifier.sol`:
        
        ```solidity
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
            SignatureItem memory item = items[i];
        
            ...
        
            if (item.cType == CollateralType.ERC_721) {
                ...
        
                // Wildcard, but vault has no assets
                if (id < 0 && asset.balanceOf(vault) == 0) return false;
        ```
        
        **Remediations to Consider**
        
        Potential options may include:
        
        - Restrict to only a single wildcard per asset.
        - Support `amt` values > 1 in the case of wildcards, and confirm asset balance accordingly.
        
        Additionally, consider restricting predicate items - for a single asset - to have *either* a single wildcard *or* any number of specific ids. This avoids complicated scenarios where both specific id(s) and a wildcard are indicated for the same asset.

        `ERC721PermitUpgradeable.sol` is missing a [storage gap](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable#storage-gaps): adding a new storage variable may change the storage layout of `VaultFactory` upon upgrade, rendering it unusable. This is presently safeguarded from occurring by use of the preset OZ upgrade library.
        
        Should there be a need to add state to `ERC721PermitUpgradeable`, consider doing so via [unstructured storage](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/upgradeability-using-unstructured-storage/).  </field>

        ## [Q-4] Overpaid amount is refunded to borrower instead of original sender

        `RepaymentController.sol::repayPart` is not access-controlled and so can be called by anyone and not only by the borrower itself. However, any overpaid amount is always refunded to the borrower, instead of the original sender.
        
        See `LoanCore::repayPart`:
        
        ```solidity
        if (_paymentToPrincipal > _balanceToPay) {
            // Borrower overpaid, so send refund
            IERC20Upgradeable(data.terms.payableCurrency).safeTransfer(
                borrower,    
                _paymentToPrincipal - _balanceToPay
            );
        }
        ```
        
        **Remediations to Consider**
        
        - Consider refunding the overpaid amount to the original sender instead of the borrower, or
        - making the function accessible to the borrower only    </field>

        ## [Q-7] Locked vault items in “collateral sale” contract requires admin action to refund items back to original owner.

        In `CollateralSaleSeaportBasic.sol::fulfillCollateralSale()`, only the vault items specified are considered to be withdrawn. Thus any items that are hold by the vault but left out in the `vaultItems` argument, won’t be withdrawn to the original vault owner. As the `CollateralSaleSeaportBasic` contract will be the owner of the vault, all leftover items are locked up in the contract and can’t be re-claimed by the original owner. It requires an admin to call `rescueAsset` function on behalf of the user to withdraw assets back to original owner.
        
        Owner-controlled functions should - if at all - only be used for admin operations but shouldn’t be used for business logic operations.
        
        **Remediations to Consider**
        
        Consider a solution which doesn't require any manual intervention by the owner. For example, adding whitelist capability to `VaultFactory` so that withdrawEnabled-vaults can be transferred only by certain whitelisted addresses (like `CollateralSale`).  </field>
        <field name="response">
            The Arcade team considered the implemented design against the suggested alternative, and reached the conclusion that no changes were necessary.

            In general, rescueAsset should not be used in the course of normal CollateralSale business logic - if vaultItems are correctly specified, it never needs to be used. Instead, the rescue mechanism is only is meant to be a recovery scenario in case an item held in the vault was not specified by the user in the vaultItems array. 

            The Arcade team found it desiriable to maintain the optionality to recover from user error, but makes no guarantees about post-launch processes to do so, or even that we will do so. It’s possible that we won’t offer rescue ability to users who make routine mistakes, and will only do so in extreme or high-value scenarios.

            We chose not to pursue the alternative of making withdrawEnabled vaults transferrable by specially-designated contracts, given that it breaks the logical and architectural independence of vaults from the core mechanisms of the protocol itself.

    <field name="response">
        The Arcade team understands the imported versions are deprecated, however replacing them with final versions led to dependency management issues. We elected to not spend  effort on dependency management at this time, given that the draft versions also match what our deployed protocol uses on-chain. Before the next major protocol release, the Arcade team will revisit this issue.

        ## [I-1] Updates to `RepaymentController` require re-deploy of CollateralSale contracts

        Any changes to `RepaymentController` will require deploy to a new address, and updating the `REPAYER_ROLE` within `LoanCore` to complete the ‘upgrade’.  Subsequent calls to repayment functions within `CollateralSale` contracts will fail, due to the old `repaymentController` no longer having the `REPAYER_ROLE`.

    <field name="response">
        The Arcade team wishes to pursue the path of using upgradeability as a last resort, and ideally only in security-related scenarios. We believe that the increased gas costs of an additional downstream redeploy (of CollateralSale) outweigh the operational risks of performing an upgrade and possible introducing an error in new code or as a result of the upgrade process.

        Gas savings aside, the Arcade team finds the use of unchecked in for-loops to be an antipattern that increases contextual overhead and makes the learning curve steeper for new Solidity developers and first-time readers of the code. In our opinion, the unchecked optimization for for-loops is one that should be built into the compiler itself, and never present in Solidity code.
