      ## [H-1] Slippage calculation is incorrect
  
  
      `amountOutMInium` is calculated incorrectly for uniswap swap inside `_sweep`.


      ```solidity
      uint256 amountInNormalized = normalizeDecimals(IERC20Metadata(fromAsset).decimals(), donationAssetDecimals, amountIn);
  
      // Set up uniswap swap params.
      ISwapRouter.ExactInputSingleParams memory params =
        ISwapRouter.ExactInputSingleParams({
            tokenIn: fromAsset,
            tokenOut: donationAsset,
            fee: poolFee,
            recipient: address(this),
            deadline: block.timestamp,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            amountOutMinimum: amountInNormalized * (10_000 - uniswapSlippage) / 10_000, // @audit 
            sqrtPriceLimitX96: 0
        });
      ```
  
      It's being derived directly from `amountIn` using decimals and slippage, instead of a current market price from uniswap pool.
  
      Hence it would either overvalue the amount expected or undervalue it.

      [https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/guides/swaps/single-swaps](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/guides/swaps/single-swaps)

        
      In the case of overvalued, it would revert only, while in the case of undervalued, it would allow a sandwich attack.
  
      ### Remediations to consider
  
      Consider calculating `amountOutMinium` off-chain using any price oracle or `uniswap` quoter and making `amountOutMinium` a user input.

      ## [H-2] Default slippage is set to a high number
  
      ```solidity
      function sweep (
              address fromAsset,
              uint24 poolFee,
              uint256 amountIn
          ) external payable onlySweeper {
              _sweep (
                  fromAsset,
                  poolFee,
                  amountIn,
                  1000, // 1% default max slippage
                  100 // 1% default max slippage
              );
          }
      ```
  
      `sweep()` sets slippage for swap to `1_000`, and the comment states that slippage is intended to be set to 1%.
  
      ```tsx
      amountOutMinimum: amountInNormalized * (10_000 - uniswapSlippage) / 10_000,
      ```
  
      However, the calculation is performed using `10_000` as a precision basis, and this causes slippage to be calculated as 10%, which is a huge slippage and will make swaps vulnerable to sandwich attacks.
  
      ### Remediations to consider
  
      Use `100` as the default slippage.

      ## [L-1] The bridge has unlimited approvals for `donationAsset`
  
  
      The bridge is given unlimited token transfer approvals. Although the bridge is a trusted contract, it is recommended to give only required approvals to external parties since any potential bugs or vulnerabilities in the bridge may cause a loss of assets in the donation contract. 
  
      ```tsx
      if (!approvedDonationAsset) {
          approvedDonationAsset = true;
          // use max approval for assset
          TransferHelper.safeApprove(donationAsset, address(connext), MAX_INT);
      }
      ```
  
      ### Remediations to consider
  
      Remove `MAX_INT` approval and approve only the required amounts.

      ## [G-1] Token approval could be moved to the constructor to eliminate redundant `SLOADs`
  
      ```solidity
      // Approve connext to bridge donationAsset.
      if (!approvedDonationAsset) {
          approvedDonationAsset = true;

      Every `_sweep()`  reads the storage variable `approvedDonationAsset` , to verify if there is a need to do a token approval.
      Instead, approval for `donationAsset` could be moved to the constructor to avoid these redundant reads.

      ## [I-1] `_sweep()` does not check for max slippage
  
      `sweep()` is a function that can be called with any slippage, and `_sweep()` only checks for the `MIN_SLIPPAGE`. Since this function expects parameters with a precision basis, it is prone to human errors(see [H-2](#H-2)) and a wrong slippage passed here may lose funds to sandwich attacks. 
  
      Adding an upper limit for slippages, similar to `MIN_SLIPPAGE`, would resolve this issue; but that may block the sweeper from swapping tokens with low liquidity and is not recommended if such tokens are expected to be handled. Calling `sweep()` through a client app is recommended to minimize human errors.
