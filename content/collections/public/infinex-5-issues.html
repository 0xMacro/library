      ## [M-1] App accounts can be deployed with an old beacon
  
      In `AppModule`, `deployAppAccounts` is called to deploy a new app account. Inside the function, `isValidAppBeacon` is called to check if the provided `appBeacon` address is registered and valid. However, the function `isValidAppBeacon` was recently changed and doesn’t check against the `latestAppBeacon` anymore.
  
      ```diff
      function isValidAppBeacon(address _appBeacon) external view returns (bool) {
      -    return appBeacons[_appBeacon] && IAppBeaconBase(_appBeacon).getLatestAppBeacon() == _appBeacon;
      +    return appBeacons[_appBeacon]

      ## [M-2] Protocol Beacon breaking changes can prevent modules from working correctly
  
      With the latest changes on Infinex contracts, [PR #169](https://github.com/infinex-xyz/infinex-contracts/pull/169) introduces some [changes](https://github.com/infinex-xyz/infinex-contracts/pull/169/files#diff-7b2d36f3ba79ae7191d44abd2affbaebdda4f587ff93eedbb4ceb4ab154c04d0) in the `InfinexProtocolConfigBeacon` including breaking changes such as renaming getters and adding configuration variables and constants for bridging directly using CCTP and syncing the funds recovery address cross-chain, as mentioned in the PR’s description:
  
      > It has some breaking changes on the InfinexBeacon but that's fine because it'll only be used by new accounts (since we are only upgrading the beacon when we upgrade the account version), and I've confirmed with the platform that they aren't reading any of the functions that are getting changed.
      > 
  
      It is not an issue if the new beacon is only used by new accounts. However, this is not enforced and the following misconfigurations can occur that will break functionality:
  
      1. An account owner (sudoKey) can upgrade to a new beacon without upgrading to a new account implementation, causing the following functions to revert:
          - `BridgingModule:bridgeUSDCWithWormholeEVM()` as the `isSupportedWormholeChainId()` was renamed to `isSupportedEVMWormholeChainId()`.
          - `BridgingModule:bridgeUSDCWithCCTPSolana()` as the `getSolanaCCTPDestinationDomain()` is no longer in the contract.
          - `RecoveryModule:recoverUSDCToEVMChain()` will revert as the `getMinimumUSDCBridgeAmount()` is no longer in the contract, as the new account implementation uses `solanaCCTPDestinationDomain` public variable getter.
      2. An account owner (sudoKey) can upgrade to a new implementation without upgrading to a new beacon causing the following functions to revert in addition to the previously mentioned functions:
          - `BridgingModule:bridgeUSDCWithCCTPEVM()` will revert as CCTP bridging was added in the latest beacon version.
          - `RecoveryModule.syncFundsRecoveryAddressWithCCQ()` will revert as the public constant `WORMHOLE_CORE` was added in the latest beacon version.
  
      Essentially rendering some module’s functions non-usable and forcing the account to be upgraded to a compatible version.
  
      **Remediations to Consider:**
  
      The following remediations can be made to prevent the above scenarios correspondingly:
  
      1. Automatically upgrade to a new beacon when upgrading the account’s implementation and,
      2. Allow upgrading to a new beacon only if the beacon is compatible with the current implementation.

      ## [M-3] App beacon `lastImplementation` is not immutable
  
      With the latest App beacon release, specifically In [PR165](https://github.com/infinex-xyz/infinex-contracts/pull/165/), the app address implementation of each beacon was intended to be set as an immutable parameter. This was done by removing the address setter `setLatestAppImplementation()`.
  
      ```diff
      -    /**
      -    * @notice Sets the latest app implementation address.
      -    * @param _latestAppImplementation The address of the latest implementation for the app.
      -    */
      -   function setLatestAppImplementation(address _latestAppImplementation) external onlyOwner {
      -       if (_latestAppImplementation == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
      -       emit LatestAppImplementationSet(_latestAppImplementation);
      -       appBeaconConfig.latestAppImplementation = _latestAppImplementation;
      -   }
      ```
  
      This would guarantee the App implementation address’s compatibility with a given App Beacon. 
  
      However, since the `appBeaconConfig` is a storage variable. App Beacon contracts inherent in the `AppBeaconBase` contract could implement a setter and change the implementation address.
  
      ```solidity
      abstract contract AppBeaconBase is IAppBeaconBase, ERC165, Ownable2Step {
          AppBeaconConfig public appBeaconConfig;
      ```
  
      **Reference:** [AppBeaconBase.sol#L28-29](https://github.com/infinex-xyz/infinex-contracts/blob/950f3568622ba185aa01ae1a65f75804071a2b47/src/apps/base/AppBeaconBase.sol#L28-L29)
  
      ```solidity
      struct AppBeaconConfig {
          string appName;
          address latestAppImplementation;
          address latestAppBeacon;
      }
      ```
  
      **Reference:** [IAppBeaconBase.sol#L19-23](https://github.com/infinex-xyz/infinex-contracts/blob/950f3568622ba185aa01ae1a65f75804071a2b47/src/interfaces/apps/base/IAppBeaconBase.sol#L19-L23)
  
      Since the App deployment and predict address results rely only on the `_appBeacon` address input but utilize the `latestAppImplementation`, not making it explicitly immutable would restrain the user’s control over the deployed apps. 
  
      **Remediations to Consider:**
  
      Consider declaring the `latestAppImplementation` as an immutable address variable.

      ## [L-1] No result length check for the `ethQueryResponse` result
      The `syncFundsRecoveryAddressWithCCQ()` function decodes the `ethQueryResponse` result as an address after verifying only one result exists and ensuring the expected signature selector and contract address match the request's data, along with some other validations.
  
      ```solidity

        || keccak256(ethQueryResponse.requestFinality) != keccak256("finalized")) {
          revert Error.InvalidBlockFinality();
      }
      address[] memory expectedContractAddresses = new address[](1);
      expectedContractAddresses[0] = address(this);
      bytes4[] memory expectedFunctionSignatures = new bytes4[](1);
      expectedFunctionSignatures[0] = IRecoveryModule.getFundsRecoveryAddress.selector;
      WormholeQueryResponse.validateEthCallData(ethQueryResponse.result[0], expectedContractAddresses, expectedFunctionSignatures);
  
      (address fundsRecoveryAddress) = abi.decode(ethQueryResponse.result[0].result, (address));

      However, the `result[0]` length is not being validated. Although the current `getFundsRecoveryAddress()` implementation returns a unique address. If Base’s account changes the function structure and returns multiple values, the `abi.decode()` method will decode and parse the first returned address, potentially allowing the function returned values to be changed without reverting.
  
      **Remediations to Consider:**
  
      Consider ensuring the `result[0].length == 32`.

      ## [L-2] Lack of `calldata` length validation
  
      To validate that the proper function call data was used in the cross-chain query, the `syncFundsRecoveryAddressWithCCQ()` uses the `WormholeQueryResponse.validateEthCallData()` library method (from [Wormhole SDK QueryResponse.sol contract](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk/blob/6794b67548e7b53b3006d60c0aef6a0591fa43e7/src/QueryResponse.sol#L578-L624)) to check that:
  
      1. The expected address is the same as the Account in the destination chain since all accounts are deployed to the same address.
      2. The call data function selector matches the `getFundsRecoveryAddress.selector`.
  
      ```solidity
      address[] memory expectedContractAddresses = new address[](1);
      expectedContractAddresses[0] = address(this);
      bytes4[] memory expectedFunctionSignatures = new bytes4[](1);
      expectedFunctionSignatures[0] = IRecoveryModule.getFundsRecoveryAddress.selector;
      WormholeQueryResponse.validateEthCallData(ethQueryResponse.result[0], expectedContractAddresses, expectedFunctionSignatures);
      ```
  
      **Reference:** [RecoveryModule.sol#L109-113](https://github.com/infinex-xyz/infinex-contracts/blob/bf5b1fbade08e501d6604b94249318bf815e71d9/src/accounts/modules/RecoveryModule.sol#L109-L113)
  
      However, the `EthCallData` result’s calldata length is not verified to match the payload for the `getFundsRecoveryAddress` call. Although unlikely, a function signature clash could cause a different function to render the same `bytes4` signature.
  
      **Remediations to Consider:**
  
      Consider asserting the `calldata` in the `EthCallData.result` is only 4 bytes.
  
      Note: This will not completely mitigate function signature collision, as the hashed function name alone can generate a signature clash. However, it will add an additional security layer to ensure transparency with the current Account code version and specification.

      ## [L-3] Setting Base block number in non-Base accounts
  
      The `Recovery` module data layout now includes a new storage parameter, which saves the block number on which the `fundsRecoveryAddress` was set.
  
      ```solidity
      struct Data {
          address fundsRecoveryAddress;
          uint256 lastRecoveryAddressSetBlock;
      }

      This value is later used in the `RecoveryModule` to verify the `ethQueryResponse.blockNum` is higher than the set number.
  
      ```solidity
      WormholeQueryResponse.validateBlockNum(ethQueryResponse.blockNum, Recovery._getLastRecoveryAddressSetBlock());
      ```
  
      **Reference:** [RecoveryModule.sol#L104](https://github.com/infinex-xyz/infinex-contracts/blob/bf5b1fbade08e501d6604b94249318bf815e71d9/src/accounts/modules/RecoveryModule.sol#L104)
  
      However, this value can be set using two different entry points: one using `block.number` and the other using the responses `ethQueryResponse.blockNum`. Since the `block.number` parameter varies from chain to chain, and specifically, the Base’s block number is numerically lower than most of the other supported chains. Comparing this value as a minimum bound will not give any assurance on the contract’s storage state.
  
      **Remediations to Consider:**
  
      - Using the `block.number` in `syncFundsRecoveryAddressWithCCQ()` setter function too.
      
          ```solidity
          function syncFundsRecoveryAddressWithCCQ(bytes memory _response, IWormhole.Signature[] memory _signatures)
              external
              requiresTrustedRecoveryKeeper
              nonReentrant
          {

          }
          ```

      However, if an account with a valid beacon was deployed and later deprecated, the `predictAppAccountAddress()` will incorrectly return the predicted app’s address as available if the beacon is still valid. This could mistakenly be used to call the `deployAppAccount()`, expecting it to deploy an account while reverting in the `create2` call as this address will contain code.
