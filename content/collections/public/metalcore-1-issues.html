    ## [I-1] Renounce ownership functionality disabled but can happen by mistake

    The ImmutableERC20FixedSupplyNoBurn contract inherits OpenZeppelinâ€™s Ownable functionality. Part of this functionality is the `renounceOwnership()` function which irreversibly resets the owner.

    The ImmutableERC20FixedSupplyNoBurn implementation prevents renouncing ownership by overriding the parent function and reverting whenever it is invoked. However, this restriction can be circumvented if the current owner calls `transferOwnership()` with an address value not controlled by anyone.

    Consider removing the Ownable functionality since it is not within the current context or using Ownable2Step to prevent accidental loss of ownership.

    Acceptable risk since it requires owner privileges.
