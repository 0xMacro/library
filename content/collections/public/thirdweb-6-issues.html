    ## (C-1) Marketplace funds can be drained due to lack of auction payout accounting

    A seller (auction creator) uses `collectAuctionPayout()` to collect their payout after the auction closes with a winning bid. The payout is in the currency specified when creating the auction.

    In v2, the payout amount was calculated with `_winningBid.pricePerToken * _targetListing.quantity`. The function then afterwards set each of these values to zero, preventing future payouts.

    However, in v3, payout is specified in the dedicated field `_winningBid.bidAmount`. This means that, although quantity is set to zero like in v2, the `_winningBid.bidAmount` remains the same. This allows an attacker to call this function as many times as they want, draining all funds of that currency from the Marketplace contract.

    For example:

    - Assume 100 WETH is escrowed in a marketplace contract.
    - An attacker creates an auction selling an ERC-721 token (doesn’t matter which one) with a buyout price of 50 WETH
    - Attacker buys out their the auction, paying 50 WETH to the marketplace contract.
    - Attacker calls `collectAuctionPayout()` and collects 50 WETH.
    - Attacker continues to call `collectAuctionPayout()`, receiving 50 WETH each time, until marketplace funds are drained (in this case, 2 additional times).

    Consider only allowing a payout if `_targetAuction.quantity` is zero, or using a separate field (e.g. `payoutTimestamp`) to track when a seller has received their payout.

    ## (C-2) Unsafe listing update allows seller front-run to buyer purchase

    In DirectListings, sellers can list their ERC-721 or ERC-1155 tokens for sale and buyers can purchase them directly.

    However, a malicious seller front-run a purchase by updating critical fields using `updateListing`, causing the buyer to receive something **different** from what was originally listed.

    To illustrate, consider the current user flow for a direct, non-reserved, listing:

    1. Seller creates a listing by calling `createListing`.
    2. Buyer purchases the Token by calling `buyFromListing`.

    In between step 1 and 2, a malicious seller can listen for a `buyFromListing` transaction and front-run it using `updateListing` to update `tokenId` and `assetContract` before the buyer completes their purchase. These values can be set to anything, including an asset contract that the attacker controls.

    Consider disallowing changes to `tokenId` and `assetContract` to existing listings.

    ## (C-3) Auction creator collecting payout causes buyer to lose their purchased tokens

    In a Marketplace contract, after an ERC-1155 auction has completed, 2 actions happen: the auction creator collects their payment, and the bidder collects their token. This is executed in `collectAuctionPayout` and `collectAuctionTokens`, respectively.

    In V2, a bid had two separate fields: `Listing.quantity` and `Offer.quantityWanted`:

    - When an auction creator collects their payout, the former is used and then set to zero, preventing further payouts.
    - When a buyer collects their payout, the latter is used and then set to zero, preventing further payouts.

    However, in V3, **both payouts use the same field:** `Auction.quantity`:

    - When an auction creator collects their payout, `Auction.quantity` is used and then set to zero (note this **does not** prevent further payouts, as described in C-1).
    - When a buyer collects their payout, **they don’t receive what they purchased** when the auction creator collects their payout before the buyer.

    When this happens, a buyer’s purchased tokens are stuck in the Marketplace contract indefinitely.

    Consider using a separate field to track bid payout, similar to what was used in [V2](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/main/contracts/marketplace/Marketplace.sol#L661).

    ## (C-4) Auction token collection not tracked enables stealing ERC-1155 tokens

    A bidder uses `collectAuctionTokens` to collect the auction tokens after winning an EnglishAuction.

    In V2, a bid a `Offer.quantityWanted` field. Upon the buyer collecting their payout, this field would be set to zero, preventing further payouts.

    However, in V3, no state is modified or checked to prevent multiple payouts from happening. For ERC-1155 auctions, this allows an attacker to receive more tokens than they bought. For example:

    - Suppose a victim auctions an ERC-1155 token, ID for which is 999. This is auction #1.
    - Attacker creates an identical auction, except buyout price is 1 wei of the ERC20 currency; this is auction #2.
    - Attacker buys out their own auction for 1 wei, which transfers the token immediately to attacker’s wallet.
    - A**ttacker calls `collectAuctionTokens` on auction #2 until there is no more ID=999 tokens left in the marketplace**
    - in this case, attacker collects the token escrowed by auction #1 for free.

    ## (H-1) Out of order lazy minting in TieredDrop causes incorrect claims

    TieredDrop is an NFT drop contract that allows users to claim with a specified priority of “tiers”.

    Thirdweb’s docs for `lazyMintWithTier()` state:

    > The same tier can be re-used multiple times, and that does not need to happen on consecutive calls to the function. The contract will always appropriately track what NFTs belong to what tier.
    >

    This allows an “out of order” lazy mint. For example, if there are three tiers, X, Y, and Z, then the following is a valid mint pattern:

    - Mint 10 X
    - Mint 10 Y
    - Mint 30 Z
    - Mint 10 X

    This creates 20 X tokens, 10 Y tokens, and 30 Z tokens available to mint.

    When claiming, the docs state:

    > As a result, the claimer receives the specified total no. of NFTs, and the particular tiers of NFTs distributed to the claimer **are determined by the provided order of priority of tiers.**
    >

    However, when claiming, the NFTs distributed **are also determined by the order of lazy minting.**

    Taking the above example, this means if a user were to mint 25 tokens with tier priority `[Y, X]` (note Y having priority over X), then they would receive:

    - 10 from tier Y (ids 10-19)
    - 10 from tier Z (ids 20-29)
    - 5 from tier X (ids 0-4)

    Consider an algorithm that takes out-of-order lazy minting into account, or update the docs to specify this behavior.

    ## (M-1) `setExtension` allows selector clashes enables incorrect select-extension mapping

    Map’s `setExtension()` creates a mapping from a function selector to a contract address that implements that function. This allows `MarketplaceEntrypoint` to delegate calls to any number of other approved contracts, achieving the same core goals as [EIP-2535](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535).

    However, `setExtension()` can overwrite an existing mapping, since it does not validate whether the selector is already assigned. This can silently cause problems if/when thirdweb decides to deploy a contract with a function selector that clashes with a previous, already-deployed function selector.

    Consider splitting `setExtension` into two functions: `addExtension` and `replaceExtension`. Similar to EIP-2535, this will help catch scenarios where two or more extensions implement the same function selector.

    ## (L-1) Create listing start timestamp accuracy

    DirectListings’s `createListing()` allows `startTimestamp` to be within 60 minutes behind the current block timestamp. This allows a newly created listing to be recorded as having started potentially up to an hour ago.

    While this poses no risk for thirdweb’s current contracts, it is in fact a data inaccuracy. If other contracts (thirdweb or 3rd party) or off-chain software were to use this value for business logic, the inaccuracy could affect calculations or introduce vulnerabilities.

    Consider updating `startTimestamp` to be the current block timestamp upon listing create to maintain data integrity.

    ## (L-3) Buyer can overpay when using buyout option

    In EnglishAuctions, a bidder can use the buy out option to directly purchase a token from the auction. The buy out price is defined as: "The total bid amount for which the bidder can directly purchase the auctioned items and close the auction as a result."

    However, the buyer can bid higher than the buy out option and instead of paying the buy out amount, they pay their bid amount.

    A quick illustration of this:

    1. The auction that a bidder is interested in has a `buyoutBidAmount` of 100.
    2. Bidder bids 120, surpassing the `buyoutBidAmount`.
    3. Instead of paying 100, they end up paying 120. The bidder overpays.

    Consider:

    - Forcing the collection amount to be the `buyoutBidAmount` instead of the incoming bid amount, or
    - Reverting if the incoming bid amount is greater than the `buyoutBidAmount`.

    ## (L-4) Off-chain application might block itself from buying listing

    A listing has two sources of truth for pricing:

    1.  `Listing.currency` and `Listing.pricePerToken`.
    2. `DirectListingsStorage.isCurrencyApprovedForListing` and `DirectListingsStorage.currencyPriceForListing`.

    Although `approveCurrencyForListing()` disallows approving a currency that is currently the listing’s currency, it’s still possible to enter a state where a currency is set in both places. For example:

    1. Create a listing with WETH as the currency.
    2. Approve DAI as a currency with a price of 100 per token.
    3. Call `updateListing()` to update the listing to DAI with a price of 50 per token.

    After this, the listing now has two DAI prices.

    In `buyFromListing()`, the `isCurrencyApprovedForListing` price takes precedence. If a contract or off-chain application were to use `Listing.pricePerToken` in this scenario, it would always revert.

    Consider:

    1. Disallowing updating a listing’s `currency` to be an approved currency, or
    2. Using `isCurrencyApprovedForListing` as a single source of truth.

    If (b) is considered, also consider combining `isCurrencyApprovedForListing` and `currencyPriceForListing` into a compacted struct – reducing uint256 to e.g. uint252 – to reduce storage slot usage.

    ## (Q-1) `_validateOwnershipAndApproval` is not needed for creating auctions

    As part of creating a new auction, `_validateOwnershipAndApproval()` is called to validate whether the `msg.sender` has ownership over the token(s) and granted approvals to the marketplace.

    However it is not needed because `_transferAuctionTokens()` will be called as part of creating the auction and it will revert if the owner does not own the tokens and/or has not granted the marketplace an approval.

    However, this may give some users a poor experience. For example, if a user attempts to claim 10 tokens during a heated drop event, but the number of available falls to 9, the user will get zero tokens even though they may be happy with 9.
