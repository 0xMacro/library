      ## [H-1] A malicious actor may preconfigure any scope with operators and whitelisted contracts under his control
  
      In the `PatchworkProtocol` contract, the `scope` is a main concept that defines a namespace with associated configuration settings valid for that namespace. If the scope’s owner is 0 address it is considered to be free and claimable. Anyone can claim the free scope using `PatchworkProtocol:claimScope()`. A successful claim will set the scope’s owner to the caller’s address while an unsuccessful one will revert due to the requested scope having an existing owner.
  
      The expectation is that after being claimed, the scope is non-configured. Also, it is expected that the new scope owner will need to configure the scope to be used properly. The scope owner can set operators, whitelist contracts, enable or disable whitelist, and update several other configuration parameters. It can also transfer ownership to a different address using the `transferScopeOwnership()` function. 
  
      However, the expectation that the scope is non-configured after being claimed can be broken by the actions of the malicious actor. The current implementation allows an attacker to front-run scope claim. Within the same transaction, an attacker may configure it with operators and whitelisted contracts under its own control. For this attack to succeed an attacker needs to perform at the end `transferScopeOwnership()` to `address(0)` making it *free* or claimable by the original requester.
  
      An original requester will successfully claim a particular scope. However, this scope will have extra operators, whitelisted contracts, and configuration settings that the current scope owner may not be aware of. As a result, an attacker may plant a backdoor in any new scope. For example, with an operator under its control, an attacker may whitelist and delist contracts, create patches, assign, batch assign, and unassign NFTs without being authorized by the current scope owner.
  
      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      - When scope is claimed it should not be possible to delete it or make it free ever again. Therefore, do not allow `transferScopeOwnership()` to `address(0)`, and
      - Emit events in all the state-changing functions so it is easier to inspect state changes with off-chain monitoring tools.

      ## [H-2] Improper implementation of `PatchworkNFT:setFrozen()`
  
      In the `PatchworkNFT` contract, the token owner may freeze it using `setFrozen()`. When the token is frozen, it cannot be assigned, batch assigned, or unassigned as a frozen state status is checked when these operations are performed by the `PatchworkProtocol`.
  
      However, the `setFrozen()` function incorrectly reads the state of the `_locks[tokenId]` instead of `_freezes[tokenId]`. It performs extra conditions and logic on this improper value. This breaks the logic and spec of the contract. For example, if the token has been previously locked, it will not become frozen even though the transaction will succeed without reverts. 
  
      ```solidity
      function setFrozen(uint256 tokenId, bool frozen_) public virtual {
          require(msg.sender == ownerOf(tokenId), "not authorized");
          //Should read the _freezes[tokenId] state variable 
          bool _frozen = _locks[tokenId];
          if (!(_frozen && frozen_)) {
              if (frozen_) {
                  _freezes[tokenId] = true;
                  emit Frozen(tokenId);
              } else {
                  _freezeNonces[tokenId]++;

                  emit Thawed(tokenId);
              }
          }
      }
      ```

      ## [M-1] LiteRef implementation approach incorrect for token IDs that may be larger than uint56

      In the `PatchworkLiteRef`, the `getLiteReference()` function generates a lite reference ID which acts as an identifier of the assignment of a particular fragment token to a particular `PatchworkLiteRef` contract instance. The given function generates a `uint64` lite reference by applying a bitwise OR operation between a `uint8 refId` (shifted left by 56 bits) and a `uint256 tokenId`. The implementation contains an implicit assumption that every provided fragment nft contract uses a sequentially incremented approach for `tokenId` identifiers. In addition, it assumes that the values of `tokenId` cannot be greater than type(uint56).max.
  
        ```solidity
        function getLiteReference(address addr, uint256 tokenId) public virtual view returns (uint64 referenceAddress) {
            uint8 refId = _referenceAddressIds[addr];
            if (refId == 0) {
                return 0;
            }
            return uint64(uint256(refId) << 56 | tokenId);
        }
        ```
  
      However, this assumption is not explicitly enforced. As a consequence, when `tokenId` values are larger than the expected max value, the overall integrity of the lite reference implementation will be affected as multiple different `tokenId` values may map to the same lite reference ID (due to silent overflow with uint64 downcast). This may affect the assignment and un-assignment of NFTs in dependent `PatchworkProtocol` functionality.
  
      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      - Explicitly check that the `tokenId` value is less than the `type(uint56).max` and in that way explicitly enforce the current assumption.

      ## [M-2] Incorrect trust assumption in `applyTransfer()` may trigger unexpected `onAssignedTransfer()` calls
  
      In the `PatchworkProtocol` contract, the `applyTransfer()` function is responsible for keeping in sync state of dependent NFTs. It is meant to be called by the instances of the `PatchworkNFT` contract whenever one of the transfer function variants is invoked. However, `applyTransfer()` function is `public` and can be invoked by anyone.
  
      The `applyTransfer()` function performs several checks depending on which interfaces the caller supports. For example:
  
      - if the caller supports fragment functionality it will check if it is assigned and revert the token transfer if it is,
      - if the caller supports patch functionality it will revert immediately as soulbound tokens transfers are not supported,
      - if the caller supports patchwork NFT functionality it will check if it is locked and revert the token transfer if it is,
      - if the caller supports patchwork lite references functionality, it will perform retrieval of all references from the caller and then iterate over returned references to perform `_applyAssignedTransfer()` for each, which will call `onAssignedTransfer()` on each contract defined by `addresses[i]` value.
      
          ```solidity
          if (IERC165(nft).supportsInterface(IPATCHWORKLITEREF_INTERFACE)) {
              IPatchworkLiteRef liteRefNFT = IPatchworkLiteRef(nft);
              (address[] memory addresses, uint256[] memory tokenIds) = liteRefNFT.loadAllReferences(tokenId);
              for (uint i = 0; i < addresses.length; i++) {
                  if (addresses[i] != address(0)) {
                      _applyAssignedTransfer(addresses[i], from, to, tokenIds[i]);
                  }
              }
          }
          ```

      As you may notice from the above, the current implementation assumes that the caller always returns valid data. However, the caller may return fake references when `liteRefNFT.loadAllReferences(tokenId)` is invoked. As a result, `PatchworkProtocol` will on behalf of the malicious actor execute `onAssignedTransfer()` for provided tokens with from and to addresses defined by the caller/attacker.
  
      `PatchworkFragment:onAssignedTransfer()` even though it is public allows only the manager or `PatchworkProtocol` contract instance to invoke it. However, in this case, this check will be ineffective, and unexpected token `Transfer()` events will be emitted.
  
      Incorrect event emissions may adversely affect off-chain monitoring tools and dependent systems. This is especially important for a project such as Patchwork which is meant to be used and integrated with by many others.
  
      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      - Consider updating implementation to perform verification that the provided reference is indeed one that exists within the system and is managed by the caller of `applyTransfer()`.

      ## [M-3] `PatchworkLiteRef`’s redacted functionality is unused
  
      The `PatchworkLiteRef` contract contains functionality for redacting (or suspending) previously registered reference addresses. This should not affect the fragments that are already assigned, but it should prevent any future assignments from that fragment contract. 
  
      However, if a particular identifier of reference address is redacted within `PatchworkLiteRef` this does not have any impact on the current system operation as the redacted state is never used or enforced anywhere within the current system implementation.
  
      Due to the above, the current redacted functionality is incomplete and unused.
      So, there should be an additional check performed when assigning NFTs to ensure that they weren’t redacted.
  
      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      - Consider adding redacted state checks when assigning NFTs to ensure that they weren’t redacted, or
      - Consider removing redacted functionality if it is not necessary.

      ## [L-1] Long assignment chains may not be processable
  
      In the `PatchworkProtocol` there are several recursive functions that are used to either check the parent NFT’s frozen state during a transfer operation or to update the ownership tree.   
  
      - `PatchworkProtocol::_checkFrozen()`
      - `PatchworkProtocol::updateOwnershipTree()`
  
      When initiating a transaction, there's a predefined gas limit, representing the utmost gas you're prepared to consume. Transactions that overshoot this limit are reverted, forfeiting the gas used until that juncture. Additionally,  every block in Ethereum has its own ceiling for gas consumption, restricting the gas expenditure for any single transaction. Deep recursions might risk exhausting a transaction's gas or risk making operations cost-prohibitive.
  
      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      - Consider limiting the level of nested assignments and/or
      - Document current limits for end users to be aware of them.

      ## [L-2] `setLocked()` and `setFrozen()` may emit unnecessary events
  
      In the `PatchworkNFT` contract, functions `setFrozen()` and `setLocked()` update `frozen` and `locked` state of the token respectively. When the state is updated corresponding events are emitted. The implementation of both functions contains logic to prevent unnecessary operations if the current state is the same as the requested state.
  
      However, due to the implementation error when the current state and requested state are both false, the system will emit unnecessary events and in the case of the `setFrozen()` function perform unnecessary increments of `_freezeNonces[tokenId]`. 
  
      This happens because the `if (!(_frozen && frozen_))` will always be `true` for the case where the values are `false` and `false` for old and new state as shown in the code snippet below:
  
      ```solidity
      function setFrozen(uint256 tokenId, bool frozen_) public virtual {
          require(msg.sender == ownerOf(tokenId), "not authorized");
          bool _frozen = _freezes[tokenId];
              //Duplicate calls possible for the case {false, false} as the result is `true`
          if (!(_frozen && frozen_)) {
                  ...
          }
      }
      ```
  
      The same issue applies to `setLocked()` which mirrors the `setFrozen()` implementation.
  
      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      - Unnecessary events and state updates may affect off-chain monitoring tools and dependent clients. Therefore, consider updating the if condition logic in `setFrozen()`  and `setLocked()` to the following:
      
          ```markdown
          if (_frozen != frozen_) {
              ...
          }

      ## [L-3] `PatchworkLiteRef` implementation incompatible with ERC165 standard

          return interfaceID == IPATCHWORKLITEREF_INTERFACE;  //PatchworkLiteReferenceInterface interface id            
      }
      ```
  
      However, concerning the `supportsInterface()` function, adherence to the ERC165 standard requires one of the following approaches:
  
      1. Inherit from ERC165 and utilize `super.supportsInterface(interfaceID)` to confirm support for ERC165's `interfaceId`.
      2. Explicitly return `true` when the provided `interfaceID` matches the ERC165 `interfaceID = 0x01ffc9a7`.
  
      Current implementation does not implement any of these options and therefore is incompatible with ERC165.
  
      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      - Update implementation to be compatible with the ERC165 standard.

      ## [Q-4] Remove redundant functionality in `batchAssignNFT()`

      In the `PatchworkProtocol`, the `batchAssignNFT()` function enables users to assign multiple NFT fragments to a target NFT in a single batch.

In addition, as expected it shares a lot of functionality with the `assignNFT()` function which handles the assignment of a single NFT fragment to a target NFT. However, this shared functionality is duplicated. As a result, contract code size is bigger, and code maintenance may be more error-prone.

      Consider relocating the `Selector` contract to the tests directory and reclassifying it as either a utility or a library function.

      ## [Q-11] Unnecessary declaration of `locked()` in `IPatchworkNFT`
  
      In the `IPatchworkNFT` interface, a `locked()` function is declared. This declaration has the same function signature as the `IERC5192:locked()` function declared in the `IERC5192` interface which `IPatchworkNFT` inherits from.
  
      Consider removing the `locked()` function declaration from the `IPatchworkNFT` as it is unnecessary, and update the corresponding `IPATCHWORKNFT_INTERFACE` value.
