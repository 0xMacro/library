        ## [H-1] Mint price is determined by quantity

        `LoyaltyCard.mintWithSignature` always only mints 1 NFT to the user as stated in the comments:
        ```solidity
        /// @dev Mints an NFT according to the provided mint request. Always mints 1 NFT.
        ```

        and defined by the line [LoyaltyCard#L276](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/ef8f6da0f3bed3c4be267a3052e21b711a74212d/contracts/LoyaltyCard.sol#L276):

        ```solidity
        _safeMint(_to, 1);
        ```

        However, in `_collectPrice`, the total price the user has to pay is calculated as follows:

        ```solidity
        uint256 totalPrice = _quantityToClaim * _pricePerToken;
        ```

        Thus, for quantity > 1, the user has to pay the total price determined by the quantity, despite only getting 1 NFT minted. 

        **Remediations to Consider**

        Consider only allowing mint request with quantity = 1 and otherwise revert.

        ## [M-1] Native token can get locked in drop contracts

        **Reference:** [DropERC20Logic.sol#L124](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/3cb172774ecbc4a77b7713ddd0e1ca6d56eb412c/contracts/drop/extension/DropERC20Logic.sol#L124), [DropERC721Logic.sol#L199](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/3cb172774ecbc4a77b7713ddd0e1ca6d56eb412c/contracts/drop/extension/DropERC721Logic.sol#L199), [DropERC1155Logic.sol#L206](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/3cb172774ecbc4a77b7713ddd0e1ca6d56eb412c/contracts/drop/extension/DropERC1155Logic.sol#L206)

        ### Description

        `DropERC20Logic` inherits from `Drop` contract which implements the `payable` `claim(…)` function that calls `_collectPriceOnClaim` to transfer payment to `feeRecipient` and `saleRecipient`. 

        The issue of locking native tokens in the contract occurs under the following circumstances:

        1. Payment currency in `claimConditions` is set to ERC20.
        2. A user calls `claim` with appropriate amount of ERC20 tokens approved and accidentally also passes native tokens along. 

        As a result, the `claim` call succeeds but the native tokens passed along will be locked within the DropERC20 contract.

        Note that this issue also applies to `DropERC721Logic` and `DropERC1155Logic`. 

        An admin could rescue the tokens by adding a new extension that provides appropriate function to transfer tokens back to original owners. However, it is recommended to avoid such situations in the first place. 

        ### **Remediations to Consider**

        Consider checking that no native tokens are transferred (`msg.value == 0`) when payment currency is set to ERC20.

        ## [Q-1] `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable` not initialized

        `LoyaltyCard` inherits from `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable` but is not being initialized in the `initialize` function. 

        Note that due to the logic in `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable`, this doesn’t impose any security risk, but it is considered as best practice to properly initialize all parent contracts. 
        
        **Remediations to Consider**
        
        Consider initializing `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable` properly by adding `__ReentrancyGuard_init` to the `initialize` function.

        ## [Q-2] Unused role `OPERATOR_ROLE`

        `OPERATOR_ROLE` is declared in the following contracts:

        - [DropERC721.sol#L83](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/3cb172774ecbc4a77b7713ddd0e1ca6d56eb412c/contracts/drop/DropERC721.sol#L83)

        - [DropERC721Logic.sol#L66](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/3cb172774ecbc4a77b7713ddd0e1ca6d56eb412c/contracts/drop/extension/DropERC721Logic.sol#L66)

        However, this role is not used anywhere else in the code

        **Remediations to Consider**

        Consider removing `OPERATOR_ROLE` declarations from above contracts.

        ## [I-1] Transfers are enabled by default

        `LoyaltyCard` allows the transfers of NFTs by default; enabled by the following line in `initialize`:

        ```solidity
        _setupRole(TRANSFER_ROLE, address(0));
        ```

        Due to the use case of `LoyaltyCard` - namely issuing NFTs to loyal customers - consider restricting transfers by default for normal users and only allow transfers for admins having the `TRANSFER_ROLE` assigned.

        `OpenEditionERC721` has been recently updated to support a new fee mechanism called “flat fee” besides “percentage fee”. However, all three drop contracts only support “percentage fee”. Consider updating drop contracts to support “flat fee” in addition to “percentage fee”.   </field>
