    ## (H-1) Reward selection exploits

    Three sub-issues are listed below. The main cause for the high severity category is sub-issue #3 ‚Äì namely, the current Forwarder.sol implementation. Consider updating the implementation to disallow contract calls.

    For the other problems with randomness, consider adding an optional flag that hooks into Chainlink, for the bigger projects that want secure randomness.

    ### 1) A block miner can tweak `block.timestamp` to either get a good reward, or skip if a good reward is not possible

    The RNG logic has three parts:

    - `msg.sender` ‚Äì always known
    - `blockhash of n-1` ‚Äì known once n-1 is mined
    - `difficulty` ‚Äì derived in nth block

    Specifically, `difficulty` is derived from `block.timestamp`, of which a block miner has some influence. Here is the formula for `block.difficulty` ([source](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2.md)):

    ```
    block_diff = parent_diff + parent_diff // 2048 * max(1 - (block_timestamp - parent_timestamp) // 10, -99) + int(2**((block.number // 100000) - 2))
    ```

    Given the above, a miner can submit their own transaction, and tweak the timestamp for either a better reward, or choose to skip the claim in search of a better reward next time.

    <aside>
    üí° In the upcoming merge, a block‚Äôs difficulty will be no longer needed, and thus be set to 0 forever.

    However, Solidity‚Äôs `block.difficulty` will remain functional, and will instead return a random value (see the details of why [here](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/29/how-the-merge-impacts-app-layer/#blockhash--difficulty-opcodes-changes)).

    Although this new form of randomness is more secure than directly using difficulty or blockhash, it should still not be relied on, since validators can still choose to skip opening the pack and wait for a better reward.

    </aside>

    If a pack gets good traction, validators (post-merge) or miners (pre-merge) will likely attempt to extract value in this way.

    ### 2) Users can use the Flashbots to claim rare rewards

    Flashbots bundle allows users to group on-chain transactions such that they execute in an all-or-nothing manner. From [Flashbot‚Äôs website](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-auction/searchers/advanced/understanding-bundles):

    > Searchers use Flashbots to submit bundles to block builders for inclusion in blocks. Bundles are one or more transactions that are grouped together and executed in the order they are provided. In addition to the searcher's transaction(s) a bundle can also potentially contain other users' pending transactions from the mempool, and bundles can target specific blocks for inclusion as well.

    Advanced users can use this to create a bundle with two transactions:

    1. Claim reward from the pack
    2. Call a contract to determine whether they got a rare reward, and revert if not

    Due to the behavior of Flashbots bundles, if the second tx fails, [then the first will fail too](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-auction/searchers/advanced/troubleshooting#how-to-troubleshoot-your-flashbots-bundle-not-landing-on-chain):

    > Unlike broadcasting a transaction which lands on-chain even if the transaction fails, troubleshooting Flashbots bundles is considerably more challenging, since any of the following circumstances will prevent your bundle from landing on chain:
    >
    > 1. Transaction failure (ANY within the bundle)
    > 2. Incentives (gas price + coinbase transfers) not high enough to offset value of block space
    > 3. Competitors paying more for same opportunity
    > 4. Bundle received too late to appear in target block
    > 5. A validator for target slot not running mev-boost

    ### 3) Anyone can bypass the `tx.origin == msg.sender` requirement via a meta-tx

    Thirdweb allows a third party to execute transactions on behalf of a user via meta transactions. Packs.sol also implement this feature:

    ```solidity
    require(isTrustedForwarder(msg.sender) || _msgSender() == tx.origin, "opener cannot be smart contract");
    ```

    In a meta transaction, a user only needs to create a signature and submit it to a trusted forwarder, having that forwarder execute the transaction in exchange for not directly paying for its gas cost.

    Because a forwarder is a contract, [any account (EOA or contract) can execute that signed tx on behalf of its user](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/109778c17c7020618ea4e035efb9f0f9b82d43ca/contracts/metatx/MinimalForwarder.sol#L47).

    This exposes a vulnerability:

    1. Attacker creates a signature with `msg.sender` as themselves, and calldata for claiming that reward.
    2. Attacker deploys an exploit contract and calls it with said signature.
    3. Exploit contract **calls the forwarder** to execute the created signed transaction.
    4. Exploit contract can then choose to revert or not, based on the reward received.T

    Since this call is coming from a trusted forwarder, the `msg.sender == tx.origin` check is skipped, and the require statement passes.

    ## (M-1) Lost ERC-20 pack tokens result in permanently locked assets

    In Pack.sol, when `createPack` is called, an ERC-20 token is minted for each pack to open. However, if any one of these tokens are lost (e.g. sent to an invalid address), then the assets in the Pack contract are permanently locked.

    The impact of this in practice depends on the value of the assets escrowed.

    Consider setting expiration date on the pack, allowing the creator to recover any unclaimed assets after that point.
  </field>
  <field name="response">
    In case of unclaimed rewards, either the pack creator will have sold the packs, or will have it in their account to open it themselves. So, we'd rather put onus on the pack owner to redeem it/transfer to correct addresses.

    So, perhaps we'll keep this feature for a later release.

    ## (M-3) Users can claim small amounts of tokens for free

    In DropERC20.sol‚Äôs `collectClaimPrice()`:

    ```diff
    uint256 totalPrice = (_quantityToClaim * _pricePerToken) / 1 ether;
    ```

    Here, `totalPrice` can be calculated as zero when the product of `_quantityToClaim` and `_pricePerToken` is smaller than `1 ether`. For example:

    - **_quantityToClaim** = 1e+12 (0.000001 tokens)
    - **_pricePerToken** = 1e+5 ($0.10 USDC)
    - **totalPrice** = 1e+17 (0.1 ether) / 1 ether = 0

    This allows a user to claim a small amount of tokens for free (assuming the currency is not NATIVE_TOKEN).

    Depending on the perceived value of the dropping ERC-20, an attacker may be motivated to claim this way multiple times in a loop.

    Consider requiring `totalPrice > 0` when `_pricePerToken` is greater than zero.

    ## (M-4) Publishing is potentially too trusted

    In ContractPublisher.sol, anyone can claim to have published any contract. While this allows a user or contract to take a trusted publisher address and see what contracts they claimed to have published, they still need to trust the claims of the publisher.

    Additionally, a single contract address can be ‚Äúclaimed‚Äù by multiple publishers

    ## (L-1) Pack opening vulnerable to DoS

    When a user calls `openPack()`, the Pack contract sends them one or many assets, depending on the configuration of the pack. However, if one asset transfer fails, then the entire transaction fails, potentially preventing pack opening altogether.

    Example case: If a pack contained USDC, and the Pack contract is added to the USDC blacklist, then every bundle containing USDC will revert on attempts to open.

    Based on the `ASSET_ROLE` code, thirdweb plans to use an asset allow list at some point. Consider using it on launch, to avoid an attacker creating a valuable bundle of assets mixed with their own malicious asset, in attempt to scam others.

    Another option to consider is isolating each `_transferToken` in a try-catch that emits an Event on throw. This will allow for some record keeping around bad txes. It would also need some sort of collecting from open pack retry feature.

    ## (L-2) Fee-on-transfer ERC-20 incompatibility

    When a user calls `createPack()`, the Pack contract transfers assets to itself for escrow. However, if one of these assets is a fee-on-transfer ERC-20 token, then the contract will end up with insufficient assets necessary to support opening all packs.

    As mentioned in L-1, thirdweb has an allow list ready to use. Consider using it on launch to avoid this issue, or document that these tokens are not supported, or update Pack.sol to perform balance differences by track asset balances on-chain.

    ## (L-3) `supportsInterface()` may prevent ERC721 tokens from transferring to Pack.sol

    ERC721 contracts that query for ERC721Receiver interface support during transfers will fail to transfer NFTs to Pack.sol, making these NFTs impossible to include in packs.

    Note that standard ERC721 implementations (e.g. openzeppelin, solmate contract templates) do not perform this check; and rely only on calling `onERC721Received()` post-transfer.  This gives this issue a low likelihood.

    Consider updating `supportsInterface()` to return true for `IERC721Receiver`.

    Unfortunately it‚Äôs common to see accidental transfers of assets to a protocol‚Äôs smart contract. If one sends ERC-20, ERC-721, or ERC-1155 tokens to the Pack contract, there is no way to recover them.

    ## (L-5) Trusted forwarders can be added, not removed

    Thirdweb ERC2771Context implementation receives an array of `trustedForwarder` values on initialization. However, there is no way to remove a trusted forwarder.

    ## (L-6) `maxTotalSupply` can be updated to `< totalSupply()`

    In DropERC20.sol, `setMaxTotalSupply()` allows `maxTotalSupply` to be set to any number. If the value is set to `<` `totalSupply()` all present and future claims will all fail, and a potentially misleading event will be emitted (`MaxTotalSupplyUpdated()`), potentially causing unnecessary confusion for users. Consider updating `setMaxTotalSupply()` to require a value `>= totalSupply()`. 

    Note that if the intent is to halt minting immediately, setting `maxTotalSupply` to present `totalSupply()` may suffer from race conditions if additional claims are processed ahead of `setMaxTotalSupply()` . In this case, consider calling `setClaimConditions()` with an empty `_phases` array instead. The latter approach will not revert if additional claims precede its execution.

    The purpose here was to achieve pausing of claims by setting maxTotalSupply as less than totalSupply().

    `setClaimConditions()` will update `claimCondition` without comparing individual `_phases[i].startTimestamp` values with respect to `block.timestamp`. As a result, it is possible to supply a set of claim conditions which will never execute. 

    For example, consider calling `setClaimCondition` with 4 entries in `_phases`, with `startTimestamp` values of: `50`, `75`, `100`, `125`.  If executed when `block.timestamp = 100`, the first two phases will never occur.
