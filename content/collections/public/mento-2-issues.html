      ## [L-1] Token can be changed mid lifecycle bricking the emission schedule
  
      **Reference:** [Emission.sol#L46-49](https://github.com/mento-protocol/mento-core/blob/95e9296fe964d02dcc599d76a05ebfbb6a4047bd/contracts/governance/Emission.sol#L46-L49)
  
      The `Emission` contract includes an `onlyOwner` setter function for the token. If this token is changed mid-cycle, the emission schedule will be disrupted, counting previously emitted tokens as emitted for the new token and potentially bricking the programmed amounts of governance token supply for any given time. 
  
      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      Consider allowing this function to only set the token contract once.

      ## [L-2] Initialization functions of contracts can be removed
  
      Contracts like `MentoToken.sol`, `Emission.sol`, and `Airgrab.sol` have initializers and/or setters that are used to set values after deployment. This is due to circular dependencies where they each need the address of another contract that may yet be deployed in the factory contract’s `createGovernance()` call. However, there is a way to know the address of a contract before it is deployed, since when deploying a contract using the `CREATE` opcode, it will deterministically deploy the contract with an address based on the contract’s nonce value. Since `createGoverance()` will only be called once, these values are known and the addresses of the contracts to be deployed can be predicted in advance and used in the constructors of other contracts before their deployment, provided no calls are made to them before they are deployed.
  
      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      Remove unnecessary setters and initializers by predicting the required addresses before they are deployed. This will reduce the bytecode size of the contracts as well as remove the perception that these contracts are upgradable/mutable.

      ## [L-3] `Locking` contract can underflow
  
      In `LockingBase.sol`’s `getLock()`function, a call is made to `divUp()` to get the `lockSlope`. The `lockAmount` is passed in as the `a` parameter which gets subtracted by 1 before it is divided.
  
      ```solidity
      function divUp(uint96 a, uint96 b) internal pure returns (uint96) {
        return ((a - 1) / b) + 1;
      }
      ```
  
      **Reference**: [LockingBase#L219-L221](https://github.com/mento-protocol/mento-core/blob/feat/tokenWork/contracts/governance/locking/LockingBase.sol#L219-L221)
  
      If `lockSlope` is 0, then the function will revert with an underflow. The case where the `lockSlope` can be set to zero is if the `amountMultiplied` is less than the `ST_FORMULA_DIVIDER`, which can occur if the `cliff` is set to zero, the `slopePeriod` is equal to the `minSlopePeriod`, which is 1, and the amount is sufficiently small, ≤ 5.
  
      ```solidity
      function getLock(
        uint96 amount,
        uint32 slopePeriod,
        uint32 cliff
      ) public view returns (uint96 lockAmount, uint96 lockSlope) {
        require(cliff >= minCliffPeriod, "cliff period < minimal lock period");
        require(slopePeriod >= minSlopePeriod, "slope period < minimal lock period");
  
        uint96 cliffSide = (uint96(cliff - uint32(minCliffPeriod)) * (ST_FORMULA_CLIFF_MULTIPLIER)) /
          (MAX_CLIFF_PERIOD - uint32(minCliffPeriod));
        uint96 slopeSide = (uint96((slopePeriod - uint32(minSlopePeriod))) * (ST_FORMULA_SLOPE_MULTIPLIER)) /
          (MAX_SLOPE_PERIOD - uint32(minSlopePeriod));
        uint96 multiplier = cliffSide + (slopeSide) + (ST_FORMULA_CONST_MULTIPLIER);
  
        uint256 amountMultiplied = uint256(amount) * uint256(multiplier);
        lockAmount = uint96(amountMultiplied / (ST_FORMULA_DIVIDER));
        lockSlope = divUp(lockAmount, slopePeriod);
      }
      ```

      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      This case should be handled by a custom error, or the minimum amount to lock should be sufficiently high to prevent this underflow from occurring.

      ## [Q-6] Revert with custom errors instead of require statements
  
      Throughout the codebase, require statements are used, which revert with a set static string. For solidity versions [0.8.4+](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2021/04/21/solidity-0.8.4-release-announcement/), custom errors can be used, which can return dynamic values to give more insight into what caused the error, as well as cost less gas on average.
  
      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      Replace all require statements with conditions that revert with a custom error containing relevant error information, in order to make it more clear why an error is occurring to the user as well as save slightly on gas costs.

      ## [G-1] Unnecessary reentrancy guards in `Airgrab`
  
      In `Airgrab.sol`, there are reentrancy guards on the functions `claim()` and `drain()`. However, there is no path for a reentrancy attack to occur. `claim()` properly follows the checks effects and interactions pattern by setting `claimed` to true for the sender before making an external call to the locking contract. Since the `canClaim` modifier is run and requires `claimed` for the sender to be false, there is no way to claim multiple times, even if the locking contract was malicious.
      For `drain()`, there would be no benefit to reenter the call as it is just transferring the contract’s balance of tokens to the treasury contract, and no intermediate state can be manipulated.
  
      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      Remove the reentrancy guards on `claim()` and `drain()` and remove it as a dependency, to reduce the gas costs of calling these functions and reduce the deployment cost of the contract.
