      ## [M-2] Incorrect `rentedUnits` accounting in `continuousCredit()` function
  
      In the `StorageRegistry` contract, the contract operator may credit a sequence of fids with free storage units. Natspec documentation and implementation indicate that start and end arguments are inclusive range boundaries, meaning that fids equal to start and end should be granted free credits too.
  
      The current implementation does indeed credit all fids in the mentioned range with free credits. However, due to an off-by-one error in calculating the length of the range, the calculated value of `totalUnits` is smaller by `units` amount than what it is supposed to be. As a result, the invariant that `rentedUnits` is always equal to the sum of all units rented ever will be invalidated. In addition, the check related to the `maxUnits` may be ineffective.
  
      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      Update `len` calculation to `len = end - start + 1` and update for loop condition to `i < len`.

      ## [M-3] Incorrect `_TRANSFER_TYPEHASH` prevents all fid transfers
  
      In the `IdRegistry` contract, `_TRANSFER_TYPEHASH` is set to an incorrect value. The underlying event signature is incorrect for the first argument - instead of `address from`, it should be `uint256 fid`.
  
      ```solidity
      bytes32 internal constant _TRANSFER_TYPEHASH =
              keccak256("Transfer(address from,address to,uint256 nonce,uint256 deadline)");
      ```
  
      As a result, `_TRANSFER_TYPEHASH` within the contract has an incorrect value, and consequently, the request digest, which `_TRANSFER_TYPEHASH` is a composite part of, will have an incorrect value. Due to that, `_verifyTransferSig()` execution will fail unless callers replicate the same error in generating `_TRANSFER_TYPEHASH` on their end.
  
      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      Update `_TRANSFER_TYPEHASH` with the expected signature for the arguments in use.
  
      ```solidity
      bytes32 internal constant _TRANSFER_TYPEHASH =
              keccak256("Transfer(uint256 fid,address to,uint256 nonce,uint256 deadline)");

      This is by design. Registrations are intentionally restricted during the trusted phase, but if a user owns an FID, we want them to be able to add and remove keys even during the trusted phase. The meaningful authorization check here should be ensuring that the caller owns an FID.

      The trusted caller’s special privilege in the context of this contract is the ability to add a key on behalf of an FID without owning that FID or providing a signature from the owner. Once the trusted phase ends, we revoke that privilege and the only way to add/remove a key is to own the associated FID or provide a signature from the owner.

      The different meanings of “trustedOnly” between this contract and the Bundler/IdRegistry are a bit confusing. We’ll add an explanation to documentation.

      ## [L-2] Assets can get stuck in the `Bundler` contract
  
      The `Bundler` contract implements a `receive()` function to allow overpayments to be sent and later refunded in the `register()` logic. However, assets sent incorrectly to the contract will get stuck in this contract without recovery.
  
      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      - Consider implementing some logic in the `receive()` function to check whether the `msg.sender` is the `StorageRent` contract and revert to avoid users mistakenly sending funds to the contract, or
      - Remove the need for Bundler to store native assets by passing the original `msg.sender` in the `storageRegistry.rent()` call so that the `storageRegistry` can refund `msg.sender` directly.

      ## [L-3] In the `StorageRegistry` the owner can set an arbitrary `fixedEthUsdPrice`

      Since Chainlink price feeds have historically been pretty stable, we don’t want to add extra complexity to the contract to handle this unlikely edge case onchain, especially since it requires coordinating calls across multiple blocks. However, if we do take emergency action that disables and re-enables price feeds, we’ll take care to follow the suggestion here and call refreshPrice manually at least a block before calling setFixedEthUsdPrice.

      ## [L-5]  Upon resetting the `fixedEthUsdPrice` the users could potentially be charged a stale rent price
  
      In the `StorageRegistry` contract, if the eth/usd price feed is unavailable, it’s not possible to rent storage units. For the system to operate in such emergencies, the contract owners could set a non-zero value to the `fixedEthUsdPrice` , which then acts as a substitute for the price feed.
  
      When the price feed becomes operational again, depending upon the order of steps undertaken to switch back to the price feed, it’s possible that the users would be charged a stale rent price.  
  
      Consider the case, `fixedEthUsdPrice` is set to 0, and there was no recent calls to the `refreshPrice()`.
  
      If`refreshPrice()` were to be called in the block where`fixedEthUsdPrice` was reset and users  attempt to rent storage units. The users would be charged stale prices, which were valid before the feed was deactivated.
   
      The primary reason for this is the following code in `_ethUsdPrice()` function:
  
      ```solidity
      /**
       *  We want price changes to take effect in the first block after the price
       *  refresh, rather than immediately, to keep the price from changing intra
       *  block. If we update the price in this block, use the previous price
       *  until the next block. Otherwise, use the latest price.
       */
  
      return (lastPriceFeedUpdateBlock == block.number) ? prevEthUsdPrice : ethUsdPrice;
      ```
  
      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      - Consider enforcing that a successful `refreshPrice()` call is performed at least one block before the  `fixedEthUsdPrice` is reset, which would resolve the issue of the users being charged stale prices, OR
      - Remove the requirement that within the same block, users are charged the previously available rent prices. This requirement is not respected in the current context when switching from the price feed to a fixed price and vice versa.

      ## [Q-1] The `Bundler` contract could be independent and reusable
  
      The `Bundler` contract serves as a wrapper contract to allow users and the trusted caller to register `fid`, `keys` for a specific `fid`, and rent storage in one transaction. Currently, this contract inherits from the `TrustedCaller` contract and has `immutable` variables for each of the contracts it interacts with. 
  
      Since the `Bundler` contract’s logic is simple and each of the counterparts performs proper access control and state sanity checks, this contract could be reusable for potential migrations and even more stateless.
  
      Consider:
  
      - Having set functions for each contract address (`IdRegistry`, `StorageRegistry`, and `KeyRegistry`), allowing to update them in case of migration and reusing a deployed `Bundler`.
      - Not inheriting from `TrustedCaller` since each `IdRegistry` call has proper access control checks on `msg.sender` and would avoid potential different `trustedOnly` states for different contracts.
  
      This would save logic execution, such as setting the `trustedOnly` state differently from their counterparts and avoid subsequent redeploys of the contract with the same logic and use case.

      However, there’s no straightforward way to pause and unpause the storage contract’s functions.
