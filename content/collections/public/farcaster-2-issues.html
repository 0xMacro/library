    ## [Q-1] Update Natspec documentation In `KeyRegistry`: - Consider
    correcting the in line comments in the bulk add and reset functions to
    reflect the correct name of the items array. ```solidity function
    bulkAddKeysForMigration(BulkAddData[] calldata items) external onlyOwner {
    ... // Safety: i and j can be incremented unchecked since they are bound by
    items.length and // item[i].keys.length respectively. //== Corrected below
    == // Safety: i and j can be incremented unchecked since they are bound //by
    items.length and items[i].keys.length respectively. ... } function
    bulkResetKeysForMigration(BulkResetData[] calldata items) external onlyOwner
    { ... // Safety: i and j can be incremented unchecked since they are bound
    by items.length and // fidKeys[i].length respectively. //== Corrected below
    == // Safety: i and j can be incremented unchecked since they are bound //by
    items.length and items[i].keys.length respectively. ... } ``` - Consider
    making the following corrections to the notice tags for the `pause` and
    `unpause` functions in the `KeyRegistry`. ```solidity //Originally /** *
    @notice Pause add, remove, and reset.e registration, transfer, and recovery.
    * Must be called by the owner. */ //Corrected /** * @notice Pause add,
    remove, and reset. * Must be called by the owner. */ function pause()
    external onlyOwner { _pause(); } //Originally /** * @notice Unpause add,
    remove, and reset.otice Unpause registration, transfer, and recovery. * Must
    be called by the owner. */ //Corrected /** * @notice Unpause add, remove,
    and reset. * Must be called by the owner. */ function unpause() external
    onlyOwner { _unpause(); } ``` In `IdRegistry`: - Consider updating the
    notice for `recoverFor()` function to reflect that one of the signatures is
    from the recovery address associated with the `fid` being recovered rather
    than the `from` address. ```solidity /** * @notice Transfer the fid owned by
    the from address to another address that does not * have an fid. Caller must
    provide two signed Transfer messages: one signed by * the from address and
    one signed by the to address. // Corrected /** * @notice Transfer the fid
    owned by the from address to another address that does not * have an fid.
    Caller must provide two signed Transfer messages: one signed by * the
    recovery address and one signed by the to address. ``` In `Bundler`: -
    `signers` param natspec for `register()` function is missing `metadataType`
    in its list of fields ```solidity @param signers Array of structs containing
    signer parameters: keyType, key, metadata, deadline, and signature. ```
