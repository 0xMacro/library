      ## [M-1] Missing guard in withdrawLockedMultiple() and withdrawLockedAll() functions
  
      In the `CommunalFarm` contract, `withdrawLockedMultiple()` and `withdrawLockedAll()` allow a caller to withdraw earned rewards and previously provided stakes. On the other hand, `withdrawLocked()` and `emergencyWithdraw()`, functions with similar capabilities, have an additional guard that checks if `withdrawalsPaused` is not set.
  
      Since `withdrawalsPaused` guard in `withdrawLocked()` can be circumvented with calls to `withdrawLockedMultiple()` and `withdrawLockedAll()` its purpose is undermined.
  
      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      - Add `withdrawalsPaused` guard to `withdrawLockedMultiple()` and `withdrawLockedAll()`, or
      - Remove `withdrawalsPaused` guard from all functions.

      ## [M-2] Incorrect implementation of setStakingTokenCap validation
  
      In the `CommunalFarm` contract, input validation references `stakingTokenCap` instead of input argument `_stakingTokenCap`. As a result, if `setStakingTokenCap()` is called with 0 by mistake update will succeed. However, processing any further staking requests or changing `stakingTokenCap` will not be possible anymore.
  
      ```solidity
      function setStakingTokenCap(uint256 _stakingTokenCap) external onlyOwner {
          require(stakingTokenCap > 0, "Must be greater than 0");
          stakingTokenCap = _stakingTokenCap;
          emit StakingTokenCapUpdated(_stakingTokenCap);
      }
      ```
  
      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      - Update input validation to reference function argument `_stakingTokenCap` instead of the current state configuration variable.

      ## [L-1] Multiple locked stakes with the same kek_id
  
      In the `CommunalFarm` contract, the `LockedStake` structure contains information about specific locked stake positions. The identifier of a specific position is `kek_id`, which is generated in the following way.
  
      ```solidity
      bytes32 kek_id = keccak256(
          abi.encodePacked(
              staker_address,
              start_timestamp,
              liquidity,
              _locked_liquidity[staker_address]
          )
      );
      ```
  
      However, with a specific set of actions multiple locked stake positions of the same staker may end up having the same `kek_id` value.
  
      Consider scenario:
  
      - Staker already has one locked stake position A of size X
          - at this point `_locked_liquidity[staker_address]` is X which is one of inputs for kek_id in next step
      - At the time `t` the staker stakes at position B of the same size X
          - at this point `_locked_liquidity[staker_address]` is 2X
      - At the same time `t` staker withdraws position A of size X
          - at this point `_locked_liquidity[staker_address]` is again X
      - At the time `t`, the staker stakes at position C of the same size X
          - both positions B and C end up having the same `kek_id`
  
      While having multiple staked positions with the same `kek_id` is not in line with the specification, the impact is limited to potential effects on off-chain monitoring and tracking tools, which may not expect that when locked stake position with specific `kek_id` is closed, others with the same `kek_id` may remain active.
  
      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      - Add validation to prevent creating locked stake positions for the same staker with the same `kek_id`

        Acceptable risk, since specific scenario is a rare corner case.

      ## [L-2] Missing validation for duplicate token reward entries
  
      In the `CommunalFarm` contract, reward token configuration can be added on contract deployment and at a later point through `addNewRewardToken()`, which is accessible to the contract owner.
  
      However, if the same reward token is added multiple times intentionally or by mistake, it will corrupt related storage variables, and `rewardTokenAddrToIdx[_rewardToken]` will be overwritten. As a result, it would not be possible to update the reward rate for the previous token entry only for the last one.
  
      ```solidity
      function setRewardRate(address reward_token_address, uint256 new_rate, bool sync_too) external onlyTknMgrs(reward_token_address) {
          rewardRates[rewardTokenAddrToIdx[reward_token_address]] = new_rate;
  
          if (sync_too){
              sync();
          }
      }
      ```
  
      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      - Add validation to check if the reward token has already been added, both in the constructor and `addNewRewardToken()` function.

      ## [Q-2] Unnecessary argument in withdrawLockedAll()
  
      In the `CommunalFarm` contract, `withdrawLockedAll()` accepts a single argument `user`, whose value must always be equal to the `msg.sender` for successful operation processing.
  
      ```solidity
      function withdrawLockedAll(address user) nonReentrant public {
          _getReward(msg.sender, msg.sender);
          LockedStake[] memory locks = lockedStakes[user];
          for(uint256 i = 0; i < locks.length; i++) {
              if(locks[i].liquidity > 0 && block.timestamp >= locks[i].ending_timestamp){
                  _withdrawLocked(msg.sender, msg.sender, locks[i].kek_id, false);
              }
          }
      }
      ```
  
      Consider removing the argument and using `msg.sender` everywhere within the function implementation to make code intention clearer.

      ## [Q-4] Unnecessary use of SafeMath
  
      In contracts `xKDK.sol` and `TokenRewards.sol`, implementation relies on Solidity versions 0.8+ which have built-in overflow checks for Math operations. As a result, SafeMath library usage and corresponding operations from the SafeMath library are unnecessary. However, the current implementation uses it, which increases gas costs for regular operations.
  
      Consider removing the SafeMath library and updating implementation to rely on standard Math operations with built-in overflow/underflow checks.

      ## [I-1] Ownable contains extra functionality

      In the CommunalFarm contract, `owned.sol` was replaced with `Ownable` openzeppelin library implementation.
  
      An ownable library adds extra functionality for renouncing ownership, which may or may not be desired depending on the expected use cases.
