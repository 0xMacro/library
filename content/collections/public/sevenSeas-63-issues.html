    ## [I-1] Delegated signer can bypass decoder validation through alternative execution paths

    The `EthenaMintingDecoderAndSanitizer` validates order parameters when the vault calls Ethena's `mint()` or `redeem()` functions through the ManagerWithMerkleVerification. However, once a vault sets a delegated signer, that signer can create and submit orders through alternative execution paths that bypass all decoder protections.

    According to Ethena's source code, an order signed by the delegated EOA is valid for the vault, regardless of:

    - Who submits the transaction onchain
    - What the `order.beneficiary` address is
    - What the `order.collateral_asset` is

    According to Ethena's API documentation, "orders must be submitted by the benefactor address." This means a compromised delegated EOA cannot directly submit orders to Ethena's API - only the vault (benefactor) can submit orders through the API.

    However, Ethena's onchain `mint()` and `redeem()` functions are permissioned with `onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE)`. If there are multiple MINTER_ROLE holders (e.g., the vault itself and Ethena's hot wallets), a compromised delegated EOA could:

    1. Sign an order with arbitrary parameters (e.g., `beneficiary = attackerAddress`)
    2. Submit this signed order to another MINTER_ROLE holder
    3. If that MINTER_ROLE holder executes it onchain, the vault's decoder is bypassed

    This would require either:
    - Tricking Ethena's systems into executing a malicious order (e.g., through social engineering or exploiting their validation logic)
    - Finding another compromised/malicious MINTER_ROLE holder

    ### Trust Model

    According to the development team:

    - Their vaults will be whitelisted for MINTER_ROLE
    - The delegated signer will be their own trusted EOA
    - There is no other way to mint through Ethena

    **Given the above trust assumptions, this design is acceptable.** The delegated EOA is explicitly trusted, so its ability to bypass decoder validation is a known and accepted risk of the system.
