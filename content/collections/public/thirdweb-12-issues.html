        ## [H-1] Any signer can withdraw the smart wallet’s deposit amount
        ### Description

        The spec states the following for the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`:

        > Only a holder of the role can withdraw the smart wallet’s gas deposit from the AA Entrypoint contract.
        > 

        However, it is possible for every legit signer to withdraw the smart wallet’s deposit amount from the `Entrypoint` contract by submitting a user operation that calls `Entrypoint.withdrawTo` directly from the smart wallet.

        The behavior applies to all three wallet setups: `Account`, `ManagedAccount`, and `DynamicAccount`.

        ### **Remediations to Consider**

        Consider adding logic to the `execute` and `executeBatch` function that prevents certain calls from executing. This could be achieved by implementing a blockList containing certain function selectors that are not allowed to be called via `execute` and `executeBatch` functions.

        ## [M-1] Any signer can corrupt the `AccountFactory`’s signers registry
        ### Description

        `BaseAccountFactory` implements `addSigner` and `removeSigner` functions to track the registered signers of an account. However, any signer can add and remove signers as they wish by submitting a user operation that calls `AccountFactory.addSigner` or `AccountFactory.removeSigner` directly from the smart wallet. This can lead to various issues such as:

        - Admin can’t grant a new signer the `SIGNER_ROLE`, as the signer has been already added by another signer to the factory’s signer registry.
        - `AccountFactory` wrongly reports registered signers via `getSignersOfAccount`. Off-chain components and other protocols may rely on this information which can lead to various issues when returning data is not accurate.

        The behavior applies to all three wallet setups: `Account`, `ManagedAccount`, and `DynamicAccount`.

        ### **Remediations to Consider**

        Consider a solution similar to the suggested remediation in [H-1], so that `addSigner` and `removeSigner` functions can’t be called via a user operation transaction.

        ## [M-2] Initial permissions are not enumerable

        ### Description
        
        `AccountCore._setupRole` is called within the `initialize` functions of DynamicAccount and ManagedAccount. `_setupRole` uses `permissions.storage` location for storing the new role:
        
        ```solidity
        PermissionsStorage.Data storage data = PermissionsStorage.permissionsStorage();
        data._hasRole[role][account] = true;
        ```
        
        In contrast, the AccountExtension.sol inherits from `PermissionsEnumerable` using `permissions.enumerable.storage`. As a result, roles added in the initialize function of DynamicAccount and ManagedAccount will not show up in the respective `PermissionsEnumerable` functions like `getRoleMember` and `getRoleMemberCount`.
        
        ### **Remediations to Consider**
        
        Use `PermissionsEnumerable` storage location in `AccountCore._setupRole` function.

        ## [M-3] Native tokens can get locked in `ManagedAccountFactory`

        ### Description
        
        `ManagedAccountFactory` inherits from `BaseRouter` which implements the `fallback()` and `receive()` functions allowing the contract to receive native tokens. This allows to send native tokens directly to the factory contract. However, there is no possibility to transfer out those tokens, keeping them locked in the contract forever. 
        
        ### **Remediations to Consider**
        
        Consider overriding `fallback()` and `receive()` functions in `ManagedAccountFactory` so that the transaction reverts when native tokens are accidentally transferred to the contract.

        ## [M-4] Potential for storage collision in `ManagedAccount`

        ### Description
        
        In ManagedAccount, the state variable `factory` doesn’t use the “storage struct” pattern.
        
        This causes the potential for storage collisions to occur, since the contract use the proxy pattern and use delegate calls to read and write to storage. Storage collisions can allow data to be set and/or read from that is not intended, causing many potential issues and vulnerabilities.
        
        Note that for a storage collisions to occur, it is required that an extension is added that also doesn’t use the “storage struct” pattern.
        
        ### **Remediations to Consider**
        
        Consider using the “storage struct” patterns for setting the `factory` variable.

        ## [M-5] Native token can get locked in `OpenEditionERC721`

        ### Description

        `OpenEditionERC721` implements the `payble` `claim(…)` function (via parent contract Drop.sol) that calls `_collecPriceOnClaim` to transfer payment to `feeRecipient` and `saleRecipient`. 

        The issue of locking native tokens in the contract occurs under the following circumstances:

        1. Payment currency in `claimConditions` is set to ERC20.
        2. A user calls `claim` with appropriate amount of ERC20 tokens approved and accidentally also passes native tokens along. 

        As a result, the `claim` call succeeds but the native tokens passed along will be locked within the `OpenEditionERC721` contract.

        Note that this issue also applies to other Thirdweb contracts that inherit from the `Drop` contract and implement the `_collectPriceOnClaim` function (such as `ERC20Drop`, `ERC721Drop`, …)

        ### **Remediations to Consider**

        Consider checking that no native tokens are transferred (`msg.value == 0`) when payment currency is set to ERC20.

        ## [L-1] BaseRouter’s getter functions don’t include default extension

        ### Description

        The BaseRouter implementation used by DynamicAccount and ManagedAccount don’t consider the default extensions in its getter functions:

        - `getAllExtensions`
        - `getExtension`
        - `getExtensionImplementation`
        - `getAllFunctionsOfExtension`

        This differs from the behavior of dynamic contracts that use the BaseRouter implementation from the *preset* folder (*see [here](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/dynamic-contracts/blob/main/src/presets/BaseRouter.sol#L85-L155))* where default extensions will be returned in all BaseRouter’s getter functions.
    
        ### **Remediations to Consider**

        Consider including the default extension in the BaseRouter’s getter function to have consistent behavior among different implementations of BaseRouter.

        ## [L-2] Incorrect `supportsInterface` implementation

        ### Description

        In BaseRouter.sol, the `supportsInterface` function is implemented as follows:

        ```solidity
        function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view virtual returns (bool) {
            return interfaceId == type(IBaseRouter).interfaceId;
        }
        ```

        Whereas the default extension AccountExtension.sol implements its own `supportsInterface` function to signal that `IERC1155Receiver` and `IERC721Receiver` are implemented:

        ```solidity
        function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view virtual override(ERC1155Receiver) returns (bool) {
            return
                interfaceId == type(IERC1155Receiver).interfaceId ||
                interfaceId == type(IERC721Receiver).interfaceId ||
                super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
        }
        ```

        However, the `supportsInterface` implementation in `AccountExtension` will never be hit as it is already implemented in `BaseRouter`. As a consequence, when `supportsInterface` is called for ManagedAccount and DynamicAccount, it wrongly returns `false` when called with `IERC1155Receiver` and `IERC721Receiver` interface ids.

        ### **Remediations to Consider**

        Consider changing `BaseRouter.supportsInterface` to return true for `IERC1155Receiver` and `IERC721Receiver` interface ids.

        ## [Q-1] Potentially susceptible to signature malleability

        A vulnerable version of ECDSA.sol is used that is susceptible to signature malleability. See details [here](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-4h98-2769-gh6h). The current version of ECDSA.sol being used is identical to Openzeppelin’s version 7.0 whereas the vulnerability has been patched in 7.3. 

        Contracts that are affected by this vulnerability are those that implement replay protection by marking the signature itself as used instead of any nonce or unique id. 

        Throughout the Thirdweb code base - whenever ECDSA.sol is used - replay protection happens either via checking the nonce or a unique id. Thus, with current usage of ECDSA.sol, there is no immediate security risk imposed. 

        Consider updating ECDSA.sol to reflect changes in patched Openzeppelin’s version 7.3. This ensures that no vulnerabilities will be introduced by using ECDSA.sol, regardless of the replay protection being used.
