      ## [H-1] Strategist can steal assets based on slippage
  
      In `CurveAdaptor.sol` the functions `addLiquidity()` and `addLiquidityETH()` gives approvals to a provided `pool` address before making a call to it.
  
      ```solidity
  
       // Approve pool to spend amounts, and check for max available.
      for (uint256 i; i < underlyingTokens.length; ++i)
        if (orderedUnderlyingTokenAmounts[i] > 0) {
            orderedUnderlyingTokenAmounts[i] = _maxAvailable(underlyingTokens[i], orderedUnderlyingTokenAmounts[i]);
            underlyingTokens[i].safeApprove(pool, orderedUnderlyingTokenAmounts[i]);
        }
  
       pool.functionCall(data); 
      ```

      However, this `pool` address is not validated to be associated with any positions in the cellar. This can allow a malicious strategist to pass in a custom contract and or custom `lptoken` that steals assets up to the slippage value set.
  
      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      Verify the passed in `pool` and `lptoken` are associated with one of cellars positions to ensure the contracts have been approved by the multi-sig and governance to not be malicious.

      ## [H-2] Unverified underlying tokens
  
      When a strategist interacts with a curve pool, by either depositing or withdrawing liquidity, an array of `underlyingTokens` is passed in but not verified to be associated with the pool. If a strategist were to pass in some but not all of the underlying tokens of a pool when calling `withdrawLiquidityETH()`, then only the underlying tokens passed in would be received by the cellar from the `CurveHelper.sol` contract. This means that if the left out tokens received are worth less than what slippage allows, then execution would continue but the tokens would remain within the helper contract, and would be free to be taken by anyone if they call it using a custom pool. If assets of a provided underlying token are directly sent into the helper contract prior to withdrawing, the slippage check could be consistently passed, leaving at most the slippage to be taken, allowing a way to slowly drain a cellar.
  
      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      Pull the underlying tokens directly from the pool to ensure they are correct and none are missing. Additionally if the `CurveHelper.sol` contract uses the delta balance of tokens received before and after interacting with the pool rather than its total balance then assets cannot be sent in to help get over the slippage checks.

      ## [H-3] Curve pricing manipulation
  
      `Curve2PoolExtension.sol` and `CurveEMAExtension.sol` allowing pricing assets associated with Curve. However Curve has been found to have some pools where the `lp_price()` and `oracle_Price()` values used for these pricing to be potentially manipulatable, which could be exploited to extract value from the cellar.

      Set bounds on each asset priced with either `Curve2PoolExtension.sol` or `CurveEMAExtension.sol`, setting a limit on how much the price can diverge from expected values. Also consider making sure assets that are priced using these extensions are illiquid and only used by cellars with share price oracles, since it has multiple guards on rapid price changes.

      ## [M-1] Sandwich griefing of rebalance execution
  
      When dealing with Curve pools that use native ETH, the `CurveHelper.sol` contract is used as a proxy to receive ETH and wrap it into WETH so the cellar can properly handle it. It will then send all the assets of the provided token types the helper contract holds to the cellar after successfully interacting with the pool and wrapping/unwrapping the ETH.
  
      ```solidity
      pool.functionCall(data);
  
      // Iterate through tokens, update tokensOut.
      tokensOut = new uint256[](underlyingTokens.length);
  
      for (uint256 i; i < underlyingTokens.length; ++i) {
          if (address(underlyingTokens[i]) == CURVE_ETH) {
              // Wrap any ETH we have.
              uint256 ethBalance = address(this).balance;
              IWETH9(nativeWrapper).deposit{ value: ethBalance }();
              // Send WETH back to caller.
              ERC20(nativeWrapper).safeTransfer(msg.sender, ethBalance);
              tokensOut[i] = ethBalance;
          } else {
              // Send ERC20 back to caller
              ERC20 t = ERC20(underlyingTokens[i]);
              uint256 tBalance = t.balanceOf(address(this));
              t.safeTransfer(msg.sender, tBalance);
              tokensOut[i] = tBalance;
          }
      }

      However, since the entire balance of the helper contract is sent back to the cellar for each token an attacker could sandwich the rebalance call using this adaptor with ETH positions to send tokens expected to be received by the call directly to the curve helper. This would cause additional tokens to be sent into the cellar and with enough assets cause the rebalance deviation to be exceed after the rebalance calls are executed, causing rebalancing to revert. Then the attacker could immediately call one of the curve helper functions using a custom pool, and retrieve the tokens they initially sent in.
  
      This exploit could be made to prevent the cellar from executing important calls, but typically there would not be an incentive to attempt to pull this off.
  
      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      Instead of sending the entire balance of the helper for each token, get the balance before and after the interaction with the pool, ensuring the cellar only receives the tokens from the curve pool, preventing the possibility of griefing.

      ## [M-2] Reentrancy guard for `CurveHelper`
  
      The `CurveAdaptor.sol` makes effort to prevent reentrancy from occurring when interacting with `Curve` pools as there has been known to be issues in the past with Curve. However, the `CurveHelper.sol` interacts with curve pools and directly holds assets that could be taken if a custom call is made when executing, up to the slippage tolerance.
  
      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      Add a reentrancy guard to the deposit and withdraw functions in `CurveHelper.sol`, to prevent the potential for assets to be stolen if reentrancy occurs via a curve pool. Note that this reentrancy guard should use unstructured storage to prevent a cellar delegate calling one of these functions and inadvertently writing to a used storage slot.

      ## [L-2] `WithdrawalRequest` with zero price can be solved
  
      The `WithdrawQueue` contract allows users to set specific request parameters to exit ERC4626 positions by relaying complex withdrawal operations to third-party solvers. 
  
      Additionally, through the function `isWithdrawRequestValid` itâ€™s possible to check whether a specific `userRequest` is valid or not depending on multiple parameters such as `sharesToWithdraw`, `deadline`, its corresponding share allowance, and `executionSharePrice`:
  
      ```solidity
      function isWithdrawRequestValid(
          ERC4626 share,
          address user,
          WithdrawRequest calldata userRequest
      ) external view returns (bool) {
          // Validate amount.
          if (userRequest.sharesToWithdraw > share.balanceOf(user)) return false;
          // Validate deadline.
          if (block.timestamp > userRequest.deadline) return false;
          // Validate approval.
          if (share.allowance(user, address(this)) < userRequest.sharesToWithdraw) return false;
          // Validate sharesToWithdraw is nonzero.
          if (userRequest.sharesToWithdraw == 0) return false;
          // Validate sharesToWithdraw is nonzero.
          if (userRequest.executionSharePrice == 0) return false;
  
          return true;
      }
      ```

      However, there are no checks in `solve()` to verify whether the `executionSharePrice` of a request is not `0`; only the `inSolve`, `deadline`, and `sharesToWithdraw` are validated:
  
      ```solidity
      if (request.inSolve) revert WithdrawQueue__UserRepeated(users[i]);
      if (block.timestamp > request.deadline) revert WithdrawQueue__RequestDeadlineExceeded(users[i]);
      if (request.sharesToWithdraw == 0) revert WithdrawQueue__NoShares(users[i]);

      This could cause users to mistakenly set their share price to `0`, and their shares get drained without anything in return. 
  
      It is worth it to note that `updateWithdrawRequest` does not perform any sanity checks on the `userRequest` parameters and is used to add, update, or remove user withdrawal requests.
  
      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      Consider checking the `executionSharePrice` of each request before solving requests or documenting this potential behavior as a known pitfall.

      ## [I-2] Use caution when basing price off Curve pools
  
      Curve has been known to have multiple exploits and effort has and should be made to reduce the effect of potential exploits from negatively impacting Cellars. 
      In the case of manipulating the valuation of Liquidity tokens: The `Curve2PoolExtension` is pricing is based on the values of the Curve pool, so caution and additional safety measures should be made to ensure pricing this way remains safe. Notably, Cellars that include positions priced using Curve pricing extensions should use the `ERC4626SharePriceOracle` which has additional safe guards, including a circuit breaker during volatile share price changes, as well as a time weighted average price that is used instead of the latest price if it benefits the protocol. This ensures that price manipulation has a limited effect on extracting value from the Cellar, and requires significant capital and time to do so, which should be caught beforehand. It is also suggested that positions priced using Curve should be made illiquid and not be a Cellars main asset, to prevent manipulation to over/under evaluate the value of these positions when users deposit/withdraw.
  
      In the case of reentrancy exploits: For each user deposit or withdrawal into Curve positions, checks are made to ensure the Curve pool isnâ€™t in a reentered state. This ensures that no reentrancy attacks can be made by users to drain additional assets out of the cellar in case of a reentrancy exploit is found in a Curve pool a Cellar has a position in.
