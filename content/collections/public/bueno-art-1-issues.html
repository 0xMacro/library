    ## (H-1) Public Mint can revert when total project mints exceed the Public Mint limit

In Bueno721Drop.sol’s `_checkPublicMintConditions()` and `airdropPublic()`, the wrong accounting variable is used to gauge if enough tokens are available for a public mint. This will result in public mints which should succeed to fail. The below condition on line 557, and a similar condition on line 302, is used to check if the public mint has enough tokens left to satisfy the user request:

```solidity
  if (_totalMinted() + quantity > baseSettings.maxSupply) {
      revert SoldOut();
  }
```

The checks use `_totalMinted()`, which tracks all mints which have occurred included phase mints, instead of just the amount of public mints which have happened so far. The needed variable of total public mints so far is not actually tracked in the code anywhere.

The current code will revert when the amount of mints which have occurred globally in the project exceeds the total amount of mints available to the public mints.
    
**Remediations to Consider:**

- Keep track of the number of public mints and use that as the comparison instead of `_totalMinted()` in `_checkPublicMintConditions()` and `airdropPublic()`.

    ## (H-2) Ending a phase will increase the Public Mint limit by too much


The spec specifics that the remaining supply of a phase should be transferred to the `mintPublic` roll-over phase. Currently, instead of the remaining phase supply being transferred, an ended phase’s whole initial supply is transferred in Bueno721Drop.sol’s `endPhase()`:

```solidity
/**
 * @dev Permanently closes a phase by capping the supply & releasing it
 */
function endPhase(uint256 phaseIndex) public onlyOwner {
    // if the phase never had supply, there is nothing to do
    if (saleState.phases[phaseIndex].maxSupply == 0) {
        revert InvalidPhase();
    }

    // transfer the supply to the global supply
    baseSettings.maxSupply += saleState.phases[phaseIndex].maxSupply;

    // remove the supply from the phase
    saleState.phases[phaseIndex].maxSupply = 0;
}
```

This is problematic because during a phase’s mint functions this `maxSupply` field is not decreased. This results in the `mintPublic`'s supply being increased by too much, possibly creating tokens that have no associated artwork.



**Remediations to consider:**

- Only increasing the `baseSetting`'s `maxSupply` by the difference of a phase’s `maxSupply` and `amountMinted`.

    ## (M-1) No validation on project’s total initial token supply

In Bueno721Drop.sol’s `initialize()` function, no check is made to ensure that the total amount of available tokens matches any specified number. Considering the importance of only selling a specific number of tokens which have associated art, combined with the complexity of setting up the initial phases and public mint token limits, we’d recommend adding a check in `initialize()` to ensure that the intended number of tokens are actually put up for sale. 

**Remediations to consider:**

- Adding a check in `initialize()` to verify the number of tokens for sale match what is intended.

    ## (M-2) `mintBatch()` can fail to enforce `BaseSettings.maxPerWallet`

In Bueno721Drop.sol’s `mintBatch()` function, users can mint more tokens than what is specified in the project’s `BaseSettings.maxPerWallet`. This is because the check for the limit is made using the total number of minted tokens per user in the mint checking functions on lines 482, 531, and 561:

```Solidity
    if (
        baseSettings.maxPerWallet > 0 &&
        _numberMinted(wallet) + quantity > baseSettings.maxPerWallet
    ) {
        revert ExceedMaxPerWallet();
    }
```

This is problematic because `mintBatch()` only mints the tokens for the phases once at the end of the function, so these checks will fail to account for the total number of tokens a user has minted in the earlier phases processed by the batch. For example, assume that the `BaseSettings.maxPerWallet` is 5 and user Alice uses `mintBatch()` to mint 4 tokens in two different phases. Alice will have successfully minted 8 tokens when the global max was 5 which is against spec.

**Remediations to consider:**

- Minting tokens per phase processed. Or,
- Checking for the global max once at the end of `mintBatch()`.

    ## (L-4) `withdraw()` doesn’t work as intended 


    In Bueno721Drop.sol, the `withdraw()` function has non-intended behavior due to the possibility of malicious actors and the existence of the public `release()` function inherited from [PaymentSplitterUpgradeable.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/finance/PaymentSplitterUpgradeable.sol#L150). The function can fail to work as intended in the following ways: 

1. The `onlyOwner` modifier isn’t effective as anyone can call `release()` for any address and initiate a payment release for a payee.

2. If someone does utilize the `release()` function, subsequent calls made to `withdraw()` before the contract’s next money-gaining event will fail. This is due to `release()` reverting when an account has no money to claim.

    

3. If there is a malicious user who reverts on money transfers to themselves, then they can prevent the `withdraw()` function from ever finishing an execution.


**Remediations to consider:**

- Removing the `withdraw()` function and just relying on the `PaymentSplitterUpgradeable`’s `release()` function. Or,
- Restrict access to `PaymentSplitterUpgradeable`’s `release()` function to only the owner and allowing the owner to specify which addresses to pay out in `withdraw()`. *Note: this remediation might be giving too much power to the owner of the contract.*

    ## (L-5) Users can overpay

    In Bueno721Drop.sol, users are able to pay more than needed for their NFT purchases. This is due to the price checks being written as a greater-than instead of an equal-to in the condition checking functions:

This can lead to poor user experience if users overpay.

    ## (Q-1) Keeping track of active phases with an array is an anti-pattern
    *Note: this is a code quality suggestion and not a security suggestion. The code changes suggested here are slightly larger than the changes suggested in other issues found so far. We will leave it up to your teams’s discretion on time vs. code quality tradeoff on whether to implement this suggestion.*

Bueno721Drop.sol currently uses an array to keep track of the active phases. This isn’t necessarily problematic from a security perspective but it is a Solidity anti-pattern.

Using an array to keep track of active phases isn’t recommended because as more phases are active, more gas is spent verifying and updating the active phases.

For example, in the `activatePhase()` function, if you have 100 active phases and you want to deactivate a single phase, you have to re-write storage slots the remaining 99 phases (which is gas intensive):

```solidity
/**
 * @dev Specify which phases are active. By omitting phase indices, you are effectively closing those phases
 * Public sale can be simultaneously activated via `_isPublicActive` argument.
 */
function activatePhase(uint64[] calldata phaseIndices, bool _isPublicActive)
    external
    onlyOwner
{
    saleState.activePhaseIds = phaseIndices;

    if (_isPublicActive != isPublicActive) {
        isPublicActive = _isPublicActive;
    }
}
```

Additionally, searching to see if a phase is active will grow in gas intensity with the size of the list: 

```solidity
function isPhaseActive(uint256 phaseIndex) internal view returns (bool) {
    uint256 activePhaseLength = saleState.activePhaseIds.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < activePhaseLength; ) {
        if (saleState.activePhaseIds[i] == phaseIndex) return true;

        // activePhaseLength has a maximum value of 2^256 - 1
        unchecked {
            ++i;
        }
    }

    return false;
}
```

Best practice solidity coding typically includes keeping the gas cost of running a section of code the same ************at any scale************. This is because (1) users have to pay gas costs directly and (2) there is a hard limit to the amount of gas a transaction can take, capped currently at [30 million gas units per block](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/#block-size). This can lead to non-intuitive functioning of array-based code.

For example, the code suggests that the number of phases is capped at `2**64`, but it is actually capped at the amount of gas which is consumed by the `initializer()` function. Considering that a single storage slot write costs `20_000` per non-zero write*, a user would consume the 30 million block gas limit setting a single storage slots for 1500 phases.

Due to the unique runtime environment of the EVM you’ll find developers utilizing map data structures with additional helper tracking variables instead of using arrays.

**Remediations to consider:**

- Using a map data structure to keep track of if a phase is active or not. This can be achieved by replacing the `uint64[] activePhaseIds` with a `mapping(uint256 => bool)` paired with metadata about the max phase ID. This will remove the loop from `isPhaseActive()` and the code in `activatePhase()` can be modified in a variety of ways to still allow for multiple phases to be toggled at once. Or,
- Adding a `bool` into the `PhaseSettings` struct indicating if a phase is active or not instead of the `uint64[] activePhaseIds` structure. Additionally make other similar changes listed above.

    ## (Q-2) No events are emitted to track state changes
    Currently no events are emitted to track state changes in Bueno721Drop.sol. It is a good practice to include events in contracts in general. Without them there is no easy way to track the history of the projects. In addition, they're useful for front end applications interacting with contracts. We’d recommend adding events to all functions which change any state internally in the contract.
