      ## [H-1] Incorrect source of assets reported in transferFrom()
  
      In the `EquityToken` contract, `transferFrom()`, when called with the destination set to the `EquityToken's` contract address itself, burns tokens and emits a `Bridge` event, which is utilized for off-chain accounting. Therefore, it's essential for reported event parameters to be correct, as sensitive downstream systems depend on these values.
  
      However, in `transferFrom()`, the emitted `Bridge` event has the incorrect value for `src` parameter as it is set to `msg.sender` instead of `src`.
  
      ```solidity
      // Emit the bridge event manually to ensure correct parameters
      emit Bridge(
          msg.sender,  // caller
          msg.sender,  // src (per the Bridge event definition)
          amount,
          address(0),
          string(new bytes(0)),
          0
      );
      ```
  
      Due to this issue, off-chain accounting may assign assets to the incorrect owner.
  
      **Remediations to consider**
  
      - Set the `src` parameter of the `Bridge` event to the correct value.

      ## [Q-1] Inconsistent error reporting
  
      In the `EquityToken` contract, some errors are generated by emitting custom errors (e.g., `RenounceOwnershipDisabled`), while in several other functions, require expression strings are used for the same (e.g., `Unauthorized` in `_requireAuth()`, `_requireAllowed()`, and `Accounting Paused` in `_requireNotAccountPaused()`). This differs from implementing these functions in `SuperstateTokenV5`, which used custom errors exclusively.
  
      Consider replacing string errors in require expressions with Errors.

      ## [G-1] Avoid multiple calls to the same function
  
      In the `Bridgeable` contract, the `setChainIdSupport()` function calls `isChainIdSupported()` twice: once to determine if the chain with the provided `chainId` is supported and once to set the `oldSupported` event parameter value. 
  
      This can be optimized by memorizing the result of the call to `isChainIdSupported()` or by setting `oldSupported` to the inverted boolean value - `!supported`.
