    ## [M-1] Quote token migration can be griefed
    
    **Reference**: [PR94#R83](https://github.com/idexio/idex-contracts-ikon/pull/94/files#diff-524b3227f3ccd14cb2f46d339208f5b244501e5afc0ed642e3145675fa1005e0R83)
    
    ### Description
    
    Quote token migration allows for the migration of the quote token from the initial source token to a different destination token. The protocol's intention is to initially use BWUSDC and later migrate it to the USDC.e representation, once it is in its final state.
    
    However, the current implementation is vulnerable to a griefing attack, which allows an attacker to break the entire migration process. The problematic part lies in the `Custodian.migrateAssets` function, specifically in the following `require` statement:
    
    ```jsx
    // Entire balance must be migrated
    require(
      IERC20(destinationAsset).balanceOf(address(this)) == quantityInAssetUnits,
      "Balance was not completely migrated"
    );
    
    ```
    
    Since the balances of `destinationAsset` and the quantity sent to the `assetMigrator` must match exactly, an attacker can transfer a small amount (1 unit is enough) of the destination token to the `Custodian` contract. This action breaks the above check and causes the transaction to revert.
    
    The issue is classified as medium severity, as it can be remediated by upgrading (with a 3-day delay) the `USDCeMigrator` contract.

        ## [L-1] Fee-on-transfer tokens not supported in `EarningsEscrow`

        **Reference**: [PR93#R197](https://github.com/idexio/idex-contracts-ikon/pull/93/files#diff-79c3dbdd6da98be532400f3cec175389a9ff6ed825c14198435ecc42078cb69fR197)
        
        ### Description
        
        The `_transferTo` function in *EarningsEscrow.sol* does not account for tokens applying transfer tax, which results in less value transferred to the `walletOrContract` address than requested. 
        
        As a result, transferring out tokens from the contract will fail on the require statement on line [L196](https://github.com/idexio/idex-contracts-ikon/pull/93/files#diff-79c3dbdd6da98be532400f3cec175389a9ff6ed825c14198435ecc42078cb69fR197):
        
        ```jsx
        require(
          balanceAfter - balanceBefore == quantityInAssetUnits,
          "Token contract returned transfer success without expected balance change"
        );
        ```
        
        This is because (balanceAfter - balanceBefore) will be smaller than the quantity transferred.
        
        ### Remediations to Consider
        
        Consider handling fee-on-transfer tokens correctly by calculating `balanceAfter - balanceBefore` of the EarningsEscrow contract itself as instead to the receiving wallet.

        ## [L-2] Use low-level `call` instead of `transfer`/`send` for withdrawing tokens
        
        **Reference**: [PR93#R188](https://github.com/idexio/idex-contracts-ikon/pull/93/files#diff-79c3dbdd6da98be532400f3cec175389a9ff6ed825c14198435ecc42078cb69fR188), [PR93#L266](https://github.com/idexio/idex-contracts-ikon/blob/691e9b9e8f181edc1686569c5bac1509b8a4b14a/contracts/bridge-adapters/ExchangeStargateAdapter.sol#L266)
        
        *EarningsEscrow.sol* supports earnings provided in native tokens when `assetAddress` is set to `0x0`. If so, tokens are withdrawn using the `.send` method:
        
        ```jsx
        if (asset == address(0x0)) {
          require(walletOrContract.send(quantityInAssetUnits), "ETH transfer failed");
        } else {
        ...
        ```
        
        However, `send` sends a fixed amount of gas, and assumes the address it sends the token to doesn’t have a `fallback` or `receive` function that runs code. If the address is a contract with a custom fallback function, like a multi-sig, then the `send` will fail, and the receiving address will be prevented from withdrawing their funds.
        
        The same issue applies with *ExchangeStargateAdapter’s* `withdrawNativeAsset` function, which uses the `transfer` function.
        
        ### Remediations to Consider
        
        Use a low-level `call` to transfer native tokens; doing so will allow any contract or EOA to withdraw without issue.

        ## [L-3] Missing `chainId` in signature for distributing escrow earnings
        
        **Reference**: [PR93#R171-R177](https://github.com/idexio/idex-contracts-ikon/pull/93/files#diff-79c3dbdd6da98be532400f3cec175389a9ff6ed825c14198435ecc42078cb69fR171-R177)
        
        The signature used in *EarningsEscrow* doesn’t include a `chainId` parameter. This makes the protocol susceptible to replay attacks when the protocol is deployed to multiple chains or when a hard fork of the chain happens. 
        
        ### Remediations to Consider
        
        Consider including the `chainId` to the signature message.

        ## [Q-1] Margin requirement change on trades is not updated in documentation
        
        **Reference**: [PR85#R268-R302](https://github.com/idexio/idex-contracts-ikon/pull/85/files#diff-36fa6b519ace1fe41e1d1673c875798e332057b3ba35f4a4b46d0a41be0272b1R268-R302)
        
        Due to new business requirements, the margin requirements have changed. The change requires to meet `initialMarginRequirement` on trades when the buy or sell position is expanded and requires `maintenanceMarginRequirement` on trades when the buy or sell position is reduced.
        
        Consider updating the documentation properly to reflect the changed behavior.

        ## [Q-2] Declare functions as `external` instead of `public` when not used internally
        
        Throughout the code base, a lot of functions (e.g. public functions in *Custodian*, *Exchange*, *ExchangeStargateAdapter*, …) can be marked as `external` instead of `public` as they are not used internally. Consider changing them from `public` to `external` for clarity sake.
