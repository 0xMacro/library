      ## [M-1] Actors in manual redeem mode may remain in processed but not redeemed state for a long time
  
      Actors for which manual redeem mode is enabled may go against the purpose of the withdrawal queue mechanism by performing step 1 of the redeem flow (getting their request processed) but delaying step 2, exchanging shares for the available assets indefinitely until an appropriate time. 
  
      As a result, they may have an advantage in certain market conditions when an unrealized loss is about to increase, which they may front-run as they can perform exchange instantly while others would need to go through the withdrawal manager queue.
    </field>
    <field name="response">
      We will consider this for the version 2 of the withdrawal mechanism design.
      
      Currently, we do not believe this to be a concern, as the manual flow can only be enabled for LPs by the Pool Delegate or Protocol Admins. This will be done only for over-collateralized pools, such as our cash management product where the incentive for parking funds is lower.
      
      This flow is also designed for smart contract integrators, so we will ensure that we review the smart contracts ahead of time to see if this would be an issue. As an added precaution, we will ask our Pool Delegates and Protocol Admins to use private RPCs like Flashbots to send any transactions that would reduce the share token exchange rate, to further discourage this issue.
      
      If an LP is seen abusing this, we can also revoke their permissions to interact with the share token or not process any future redemption requests.

      ## [M-2] Maple Withdrawal Manager may be created with values that break invariant

      In the withdrawal-manager-cyclical module, `MapleWithdrawalManagerInitializer._initialize()` does not perform safe downcasting of provided inputs, such as `startTime_`, `cycleDuration_`, and `windowDuration_`. As a result, the provided system invariant may be broken.
  
      > The system is designed to reject any attempts to set a start time that falls in the past.
  
      If provided `startTime_`, `cycleDuration_`, and `windowDuration_` are greater than uint64, their values will pass initial checks such as `startTime_ >= block.timestamp`, but these values will get truncated on assignment, and incorrect values will be set in cycleConfigs[0]. Allowing even startTime to be 0.
  
      ```solidity
      function _initialize(address pool_, uint256 startTime_, uint256 cycleDuration_, uint256 windowDuration_) internal {
              require(pool_           != address(0),      "WMI:ZERO_POOL");
              require(startTime_      >= block.timestamp, "WMI:INVALID_START");
              require(windowDuration_ != 0,               "WMI:ZERO_WINDOW");
              require(windowDuration_ <= cycleDuration_,  "WMI:WINDOW_OOB");
  
              pool        = pool_;
              poolManager = IPoolLike(pool_).manager();
  
              cycleConfigs[0] = CycleConfig({
                  initialCycleId:   1,
                  initialCycleTime: uint64(startTime_),
                  cycleDuration:    uint64(cycleDuration_),
                  windowDuration:   uint64(windowDuration_)
              });
  
              emit Initialized(pool_, cycleDuration_, windowDuration_);
              emit ConfigurationUpdated({
                  configId_:         0,
                  initialCycleId_:   1,
                  initialCycleTime_: uint64(startTime_),

          }
      ```

         // @audit - startTime set to large value 
         bytes memory calldata_ = abi.encode(address(pool), uint256(type(uint64).max) + 1, 7 days, 2 days);
  
          MapleWithdrawalManager withdrawalManager_ = MapleWithdrawalManager(factory.createInstance(calldata_, "SALT"));
  
          (
              uint64 initialCycleId_,
              uint64 initialCycleTime_,
              uint64 cycleDuration_,
              uint64 windowDuration_
          ) = withdrawalManager_.cycleConfigs(0);
  
          assertEq(withdrawalManager_.pool(),           address(pool));
          assertEq(withdrawalManager_.latestConfigId(), 0);
  
          assertEq(initialCycleId_,   1);
          // @audit - initialCycleTime should never be smaller than block.timestamp
          // but because of truncation of values larger than type(uint64).max it ends up being 0
          assertEq(initialCycleTime_, 0);
          assertEq(cycleDuration_,    7 days);
          assertEq(windowDuration_,   2 days);
      }
      ```
  
      **Remediations to consider:**
  
      - Update implementation to perform safe downcasting and revert in case of out-of-range values.

      ## [L-1] `hasPermissions()` will return true if there are no lenders passed
  
      `MaplePoolPermissionManager`'s `hasPermission` function accepts an arbitrary length array for `lenders_` and loops through all addresses passed to check the corresponding pool permission level and bitmap. However, if no lenders are passed to this function, the returned value will be `true`, potentially allowing access to gated functions without permission. 
  
      It is worth mentioning that this is not possible in the current codebase, as it’s impossible to provide arbitrary values to this function outside of external off-chain calls to the view function. 
  
      Consider returning `false` if no lenders are provided. Alternatively, document this behavior to avoid pitfalls.

      ## [Q-4] Inconsistent whenProtocolNotPaused behavior between Withdrawal Managers
  
      Across the two withdrawal manager contract types (queue and cyclical) there are logic inconsistencies in implementing pausable functionality.

      ## [Q-5] Improper condition in _processManualExit()
  
      In the `MapleWithdrawalManager`, `_processManualExit()` has the following implementation.
  
      ```solidity
      function _processManualExit( uint256 shares_, address owner_)
          internal returns ( uint256 redeemableShares_, uint256 resultingAssets_)
      {
          require(shares_ > 0,                              "WM:PE:NO_SHARES");
          require(shares_ <= manualSharesAvailable[owner_], "WM:PE:TOO_MANY_SHARES");
  
          ( redeemableShares_ , resultingAssets_ ) = _calculateRedemption(shares_);
  
          // @audit - case when shares_ < redeemableShares_ is not reachable
          require(shares_ <= redeemableShares_, "WM:PE:NOT_ENOUGH_LIQUIDITY");
          ...
      }
      ```
  
      The value of `redeemableShares_` returned from the `_calculateRedemption()` is always represented by the following relationship `redeemableShares_ <= shares_`. Therefore, `shares_` cannot ever be smaller than `redeemableShares_`.
  
      The same logic applies to the similar guard condition in the `processRedemptions()` function.

      require(maxSharesToProcess_ <= redeemableShares_, "WM:PR:LOW_LIQUIDITY");

      Maple Finance now features two types of withdrawal managers: Cyclical and Queue withdrawal managers. Both of these withdrawal managers feature upgrade functionality, which is access-controlled. However, access control is inconsistent.
  
      Upgrading the cyclical withdrawal manager is allowed for the pool delegate **or governor**, while in the case of the queue withdrawal manager, upgrades are allowed to be performed by the pool delegate **or** **security admin**.

      Due to the above, fine-grained control over paused functionality on a specific contract instance is unavailable. However, a fallback is a pauseable functionality on the factory level. Functions missing `whenProtocolNotPaused` modifier:

      ## [I-1] Default bitmaps for Pool and Function level permission allow permissionless access

      In the pool-permission-manager module, the `MaplePoolPermissionManager` contract implements several modes for access control. Two modes that allow function level control and higher level but less fine-grained pool level control are represented by `FUNCTION_LEVEL` and `POOL_LEVEL` constant values.
  
      These modes require corresponding bitmaps to be set in `poolBitmaps` mapping storage variable for each pool. When values in specific bitmap match bitmaps of lenders from respective `lenderBitmaps` mapping entries, access is allowed; otherwise is denied.
  
      However, **the default when corresponding bitmaps in these two modes are not set is to allow anyone access**. This default comes with a high risk of misconfiguration, and actors responsible for configuring the permission manager (pool delegate and protocol admins) must take necessary precautions.
  
      While this design choice is intentional, and it is meant to allow transfers to be allowed by default, Maple Finance will need to ensure that pool delegates are aware of misconfiguration risks.

      ## [I-2] Config change delay period may be too short
  
      In the cyclical withdrawal manager, the delay period when the new configuration starts to apply is +3 from the current cycle. This allows all users who have already locked their shares not to be affected during withdrawal (in case of enough liquidity during withdrawal).
  
      ```solidity
      When the pool delegate changes the configuration, it will take effect only on the start of the third cycle.
      This way all users that have already locked their shares will not have their withdrawal time affected.
  
          C1       C2       C3             C4

      Users that request a withdrawal during C1 will withdraw during WW3 using the old configuration.
      Users that lock their shares during and after C2 will withdraw in windows that use the new configuration.
      ```
  
      However, if a delay is meant to be used as a Timelock mechanism to allow those unhappy with the new configuration to exit, the defined delay may be too short. Depending at which moment the new config is set in the current cycle, those users who haven’t locked their shares yet may have time from  `0 < time-to-decide < cycleDuration` to decide on their withdrawal. This, in extreme cases, is a too short time period for the user to react.
  
      Consider increasing the delay to +4, so that users who haven’t yet locked their shares have at least one full cycle to decide on their withdrawal.
    </field>

        We don’t see this as an issue as the user will still be able to request to withdraw in C2 and be able to exit in C4 as the window duration will still be at the start of C4. But we will keep this in mind for future designs.

      ## [I-3] Not checking for L2 sequencer in Base contracts
  
      As suggested by [Chainlink documentation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#overview), Optimistic L2 oracle implementations should check their corresponding L2 Sequencer uptime feed to ensure that the sequencer is live before trusting the data feed returned by the oracle. Even with the Oracle staleness price check, if the sequencer is down, there could be multiple price changes provided by the Oracle that won’t go through and will get queued and applied once the sequencer is up; if price changes are high, it could cause unfair conditions for users and borrowers.
  
      Maple **Base** Oracles are currently not being used by the protocol; if enabled checks should be added to verify that the sequencer is live and provide a grace period to react to potential high price changes (See suggested example in [Chainlink docs](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#example-code)).
