        ## (M-1) Delegate can send an account’s funds to the treasury
        
        In Account.sol, a set delegate is able to execute multiple commands using `execute()` and `_dispatch()`. In these calls, parameters are passed in to make the proper execution.

        However, the `market` contract address that the call is made on is also passed in as a parameter, and no checks are made to ensure this is a trusted contract.

        Although there is not much a malicious contract can do to directly affect the account, it can be setup to return an assetPrice that sets the execution fee to be the amount of sUSD held in the account, draining it and sending to the set treasury address.

        In most cases, this would be a griefing attack as they don’t have control over the treasury wallet, but anyone that does could steal all funds held in accounts that have been delegated to them.

        **Remediations To Consider**

        Instead of having the `market` address as a parameter, use a marketKey, and query the address from the addressResolver using `_getPerpsV2Market()`. This will ensure calls are made to an actual market contract preventing malicious contract calls.

        ## (M-2) Delegates not reset when Account ownership is transferred

        In Account.sol, an owner can add one or more delegates who are authorized to perform sensitive operations related to that account.

        When Account ownership is transferred to a new owner, the new owner may not be aware that previously configured delegates are still set and can execute actions for the account.

        This may lead to situations where the previous account owner has backdoor access to the new owner’s account.

        **Remediations To Consider**

        - Remove all configured delegates when Account ownership is transferred, and
        - Provide additional functionality for enumerating configured delegates.
    </field>
    <field name="response">
        If ownership is canceled, the user should remove delegates if necessary. in most cases, I’d imagine ownership transfer is to another controlled EOA that would want the same functionality the delegates are already providing.

        ## (M-3) Account may get locked due to error-prone ownership transfer

        In Account.sol, the account owner may transfer ownership to the new address by calling the `transferOwnership()`. However, there is no validation that the new address provided is valid or that it can be used to interact with the account. In case it is invalid, privileged actions accessible only by the account owner will not be executable. In addition, all MARGIN_ASSET withdrawals will be directed toward an invalid owner address.

        **Remediations To Consider**

        - Implement 2 step ownership transfer process, where the new owner needs to claim the account for it to be considered transferred.

        ## (L-1) Fees can be changed and exceed 100% of a trades value
        In Settings.sol, the fees that an account pays for making a transaction can be set by the owner of the contract by calling `setTradeFee()`, `setLimitOrderFee()`, and `setStopOrderFee()`. The only restriction is that the new doesn’t exceed the `MAX_BPS`, which caps the fee at 100% of the `sizeDelta` of an account transaction. When a conditional trade is made in Account.sol, the `tradeFee` and either the `stopOrderFee` or `limitOrderFee` add together to determine the total fee for the transaction, allowing a max fee of 200% of a trades value.

        Since these trade values can be set at any time, the owner could increase the trade fee to be 100% and users funds would either be locked or taken by the set `treasury` address.

        **Remediations To Consider**

        Either

        - Set a max trade fee that is more reasonable.
        - Ensure the owner of the settings contract is a multisig with a sufficient timelock to allow users time to exit their position if malicious fees are set.

        ## (L-2) Ensure market is active for conditional trades

        In Account.sol’s `_validConditionalOrder()` is called by Gelato to check if a set conditional trade has met the conditions to trigger its execution. The execution occurs when Gelato calls `executeConditionalOrder()`, and is not supposed to revert.

        However, there is the possibility for a market to be inactive or paused for multiple reasons, and the status of the market isn’t validated in `_validConditionalOrder()`, potentially causing the execution to revert if interacting with an inactive market.

        **Remediations To Consider**

        In `_validConditionalOrder()` check to ensure the market is active to prevent conditional trades from failing to execute.

        ## (L-3) Account is not upgrade safe

        Account.sol is intended to be deployed as an implementation contract, with proxies delegating to the current implementation which is retrieved from Factory.sol. Account inherits from multiple contracts which don’t have a storage gap set. If Account needs an upgrade, this can potentially limit the options of what can be upgraded, as there is a potential for storage collisions to occur if not handled properly.

        **Remediations To Consider**

        Add storage gaps to Account.sol’s inherited contracts to allow more freedom for future upgrades.

        ## (G-1) Shifting arrays is expensive

        In Factory.sol, when the ownership of an account gets updated, the account calls `updateAccountOwnership()`, which updates an array of accounts owned by an owner, removing the account from the old owner account’s array and adding it to the new owner’s account array.

        However, when removing the account from the old owner, it loops through the array until the address is found, then calls `_shiftArrayLeftFrom()`, which removes the account address at the passed-in index, then shifts every address after the removed one each a space to the left. If an address owns many accounts, this can be expensive, as each address shifted is a storage write.

        **Remediations To Consider**

        Instead of shifting the addresses, retrieve the address at the end of the array and set it to the index that is being removed, then `pop()` the array. This ensures there is only a single storage write, no matter the size of the address array.

        ## (G-2) Unnecessary repeated calls to _getPerpsV2Market()

        In Account.sol’s `executeConditionalOrder()`, there are multiple calls to `_getPerpsV2Market()`, which is an external function call to retrieve the `market` contract from a `marketKey`, each call costs unnecessary additional gas.

        **Remediations To Consider**

        Call `_getPerpsV2Market()` and store the resulting address in memory, and reuse it where necessary.

        ## (G-3) `futuresMarketManager` can be immutable

        In Account.sol, `futuresMarketManager` is set in the initializer by querying the ADDRESS_RESOLVER for its contract address.

        However, the futuresMarketManager is unlikely to change, and can be set in the constructor using the same method.

        **Remediations To Consider**

        Set the futuresMarketManager in the constructor rather than on each initialization. This will reduce gas costs of deployment and operation.

        ## (Q-1) Unnecessary account parameter in events

        In Events.sol, each function ensures the caller is an account contract by querying the Factory.sol contract. It then emits the relevant events, taking in an `account` address as a parameter.

        However, each call to these functions by the Account.sol contract passes in its own address as the `account` parameter, meaning `account` will always equal `msg.sender`.

        Remove the account parameter from each function in Event.sol, and replace with msg.sender.

        ## (Q-2) Unnecessary parameter and check
        In Factory.sol’s `updateAccountOwnership()`, an `_account` address is passed in and checked to see if it’s a valid address, and if msg.sender equals _account:

        ```solidity

        if (!accounts[_account]) revert AccountDoesNotExist();

        // ensure function caller is the account
        if (msg.sender != _account) revert OnlyAccount();
        ```

        However, the same thing can be accomplished by checking `msg.sender` on the `accounts` mapping, removing the need for an `_account` parameter and the second check that throws `OnlyAccount`

        **Remediations To Consider**

        Remove the `_account` parameter and replace all instances of it with msg.sender. Also remove the check if `msg.sender` ≠ `_account`.

        ## (Q-3) FreeMargin check can be made into internal function

        In Account.sol, there are multiple checks to ensure that if there is sufficient `freeMargin()` to allow a trade to occur. These checks are found in functions, `_modifyAccountMargin`, `_perpsV2ModifyMargin`, `_placeConditionalOrder`, and `_imposeFee`, each are very similar or identical to each other and can be replaced with an internal function.

        **Remediations To Consider**

        ## (Q-4) Duplicate calls to `transferMargin()`

        In Account.sol’s `_perpsV2ModifyMargin()` there is a branch if `_amount` is greater than zero:

        ```solidity
        if (_amount > 0) {

            revert InsufficientFreeMargin(freeMargin(), uint256(_amount));
