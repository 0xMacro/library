      ## [M-1] The Owner can renounce ownership, leading to inaccessible assets
  
      Both `SaleDeposit` and `SaleDepositWhitelist` contracts inherit from the Ownable OZ library. The Ownable library has the `renounceOwnerhship()` capability, which, if invoked by the owner intentionally or by mistake, will set address(0) as the current owner.
  
      As a result, all functions protected by the modifier `onlyOwner()` will no longer be accessible. This also includes the `withdraw()` function, which is the only mechanism to access deposited assets.
  
      **Remediations to consider**
  
      - To prevent losing access to assets, override the `renounceOwnership()` function and revert to prevent parent implementation from resetting the owner.

      ## [L-1] Withdraw may transfer assets to 0 address

      In `SaleDeposit` and `SaleDepositWhitelist` contracts, the `withdraw()` function implementation allows `_recipient` input address to be 0 address. In addition, natspec comments for these functions indicate that `withdraw()` ”could be used to transfer the token to the 0 address”.
  
      However, if this happens, assets will be unretrievable and lost.
  
      **Remediations to consider**
  
      - Add validation check to prevent sending assets to the `_recipient` with 0 address.

      ## [Q-1] SafeMath unnecessary in 0.8+ Solidity version
  
      The SafeMath lib is used in `SaleDeposit` and `SaleDepositWhitelist` contracts. However, SafeMath is unnecessary as Solidity in versions 0.8+ has, by default, overflow and underflow checks.
  
      Consider removing SafeMath from these two contracts and replacing instances of `mul()` operation calls with default `*` operation.

      ## [Q-2] Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

      Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.14;`

      ## [Q-3] PUSH0 is not supported by all chains
  
      Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains or alternative L1s that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

      ## [Q-4] Use Solidity custom errors
  
      Since version 0.8.4, [custom errors](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2021/04/21/custom-errors/) represent a more convenient and gas-efficient way to explain to users why an operation failed. Consider replacing current `require` expressions with string errors with custom errors.

    <field name="response">
        We are still comfortable to just use the require approach here, since we experienced some decoding issues in explorers when we tried custom error approach.

      ## [Q-5] Update OpenZeppelin dependency to the latest version
  
      Currently, the project relies on OpenZeppelin dependency with version `"^4.3.1"`. Many versions, including the one mentioned, have been affected by [published security advisories in the past.](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security)
  
      ```solidity
      // in package.json
      "@openzeppelin/contracts": "^4.3.1"
      ```
  
      Consider updating the open Zeppelin library dependency to the latest version without known security advisories - currently, that is [v4.9.6](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v4.9.6).

      ## [I-1] Centralization risk
  
      Both `SaleDeposit` and `SaleDepositWhitelist` contracts are designed to collect user asset deposits and enable the contract owner to withdraw them. The contract owner must be trusted to perform the expected actions upon withdrawing users’ deposits.
  
      In addition, the owner may update the allowlist at any time in the case of the `SaleDepositWhitelist` contract.
