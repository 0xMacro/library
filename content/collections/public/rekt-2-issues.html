      ## [Q-1] Use UUPS upgradeable pattern
  
      Currently [RektClaimUpgradeable.sol](https://github.com/x-hzc/rekt/blob/a4c5f57e855a80555c0840e88d3c4d9a869f4d2f/contracts/RektClaimUpgradable.sol) is set to be upgradeable, but there is no indication of the upgradeable proxy that will be used and the conditions/permissions required to upgrade it.
  
      The current suggested pattern is to use [UUPS](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol) (Universal Upgradable Proxy Standard) pattern, which allows for transparent upgrade permissions, more security when upgrading and the ability to remove upgradeability from the contract if desired.
  
      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      Have `RektClaimUpgradeable.sol` inherit [UUPSUpgradeable.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol) and deploy using [ERC1967Proxy](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/proxy/ERC1967/ERC1967Proxy.sol)

      ## [G-1] Use a bitmap to track claims
  
      In [RektClaimUpgradeable.sol](https://github.com/x-hzc/rekt/blob/a4c5f57e855a80555c0840e88d3c4d9a869f4d2f/contracts/RektClaimUpgradable.sol) to prevent reclaiming each request holds a nonce that is matched to the user using Openzeppelin’s [NoncesUpgradeable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/utils/NoncesUpgradeable.sol). However, this means the first claim for each user cost the full 20k gas storage write, with each subsequent costing 2.9k gas for an update.
      If rather than nonces, each request used a unique and sequential id, then a bitmap could be used allowing each storage slot to track 256 claims. This allows for the majority of users to save gas.
  
      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      Track claims using a bitmap to save users gas. It is suggested to use Openzeppelin’s [BitMaps.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/structs/BitMaps.sol).
