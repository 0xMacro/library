    ## [M-1] CoCreateProject Admin is not transferrable

    A CoCreateProject contract has the concept of a “contract owner” via the `admin` variable, separate from the `AccessControlUpgradeable` library contract it already inherits.

    However, this `admin` address is not modifiable. Consider writing a function so that a current `admin` can transfer to a new address.

    ## [I-1] Admin may get out of sync on future state updates

    When a new ProjectToken contract is deployed, it adopts its parent CoCreateProject’s contract owner as its own owner:

    ```solidity
    _transferOwnership(_coCreateProject.getContractOwner());
    ```

    This pattern only reads the owner once. If the parent CoCreateProject were to change contract owners, the child ProjectToken’s owner would be out of sync.

    **The Co:Create team has expressed this is acceptable**, and it’s not a requirement for the two owner values to be in sync. We report this only for informational purposes.

    ## [I-2] Roles may get out of sync on future state updates

    When CoCreateProject is first deployed, it assigns its `contractOwner` multiple roles:

    ```solidity
    _setupRole(PROJECT_ADMIN_ROLE, contractOwner);
    _setupRole(GOVERNANCE_ROLE, contractOwner);
    ```

    Secondly, CoCreateProject’s `transferContractOwner()` allows transferring its `contractOwner` to a new address.

    However, transferring in this way does not set up the new `contractOwner` with the above two initially assigned roles.

    Consider this when transferring contract owner. If the new `contractOwner` should have the same authority as the previous, then the previous roles must be configured manually.
