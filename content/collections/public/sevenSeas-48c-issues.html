        ## [I-1] Vulnerable Dependency in `boring-vault-ui`

        The [boring-vault-ui repo](https://github.com/Se7en-Seas/boring-vault-ui/) uses a version of `spl-token` that imports a vulnerable library named `bigint-buffer`. Examining the specific usage shows that each instance of `AccountLayout.decode` interacts with the `toBigIntLE()` function, which contains the vulnerable code. 

        The vulnerability should not be exploitable if the code prevents malicious users from supplying buffer overflow values. However, since the off-chain JavaScript portion was outside the audit's scope, Macro did not investigate this further.

    <field name="response">
        The usage of spl-token functions always take in publicKey types, which have defined limits. The buffer overflow is not possible because it doesnâ€™t allow arbitrary lengths.
