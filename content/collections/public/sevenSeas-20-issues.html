      ## [L-1] Unsanitized `evm_recipient` can lead to the funds being stuck in the bridge forever
  
      In order to bridge tokens using Hyperlane protocol, the input destination recipient address must be 32 bytes to generalize the case where the destination chain is not an EVM-compatible chain.
  
      Since the Boring Bridge Holder intends to bridge only from the Eclipse chain to the ETH chain, it’s  unnecessary to store the destination recipient address in 32 bytes. The `evm_recipient` configuration in the program currently has `[u8; 32]` type.
  
      However, 32 bytes allows for a potentially malformed address. If a value has any data in the 12 leftmost bytes, this will cause the transaction to fail on the ETH chain (specifically, Hyperlane’s [TypeCasts helper](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/1159e0f4ba935e5fbdb196143cb06ffb61f94a53/solidity/contracts/libs/TypeCasts.sol#L13-L14)), leaving the funds stuck in the bridge indefinitely.
  
      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      Consider changing `evm_recipient` type to `[u8; 20]` type, then converting to `[u8; 32]` type when cross-program invocating to the Hyperlane protocol.

    </field>
    <field name="response">
        We recognize that having the 32 byte evm recipient could lead to stuck funds if an improper EVM address is supplied. 
        To mitigate this we will throughly test the set configuration to confirm that it does in fact bridge assets back to the proper EVM address. 
        Because of the config hash setup if the strategist were to then pass in a malformed evm address, the transaction would revert from the generated hash being different from the one stored in the BoringState account

      ## [Q-1] Hardcoded space calculation

  
      Currently, when initializing a new boring account, the account size is manually calculated based on the size of the `BoringState` struct. Rather than calculating this ourselves, we can use the `std::mem::size_of` utility to determine the size of the struct we are trying to store:
  
      ```diff
      + use std::mem::size_of;
  
      ...
  
      pub struct Initialize<'info> {
          #[account(
              init,
              payer = signer,
      -       space = 8 + 32 + 32 + 32 + 32 + 1,
      +       space = typeof::<BoringState>() + 8,
              seeds = [b"boring_state", signer.key().as_ref()],
              bump
          )]
          pub boring_account: Account<'info, BoringState>,
          #[account(mut)]
          pub signer: Signer<'info>,
          pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
      }
      ```

      ## [Q-2] Unnecessary `#[account()]` field-level attributes

      Throughout the program, some struct fields use the `#[account()]` attributes with empty parentheses, which adds no logical functionality. Consider removing these `#[account()]` attributes.

      ## [Q-3] Unnecessary `#[account(mut)]` field-level attributes
  
      In the `UpdateOwner`, `UpdateStrategist`, and `UpdateConfiguration` struct, there are struct fields called `signer` using `#[account(mut)]` attributes. 
  
      Generally,`#[account(mut)]` field-level attribute used in a `Signer` type field is when that signer is spending or receiving lamports (not including gas payment) within the transaction. In our case, `transfer_ownership()`, `update_strategist()`, and `update_configuration()` functions will not affect the caller’s balance; hence, we can safely remove the `#[account(mut)]` attributes from those struct fields.
