      ## [H-1] Users can bypass withdrawal queue
  
      [`BoringOnChainQueue.sol`](https://github.com/Se7en-Seas/boring-vault/blob/ec74b24330a1d7b144dc397c1c20c76e3d6fc460/src/base/Roles/BoringQueue/BoringOnChainQueue.sol) allows users to request to withdraw BoringVault shares for accepted withdrawal assets, although there is a waiting period before the request can be fulfilled. Requests are intended to be fulfilled by users or solvers via the [`solveOnChainWithdraws()`](https://github.com/Se7en-Seas/boring-vault/blob/ec74b24330a1d7b144dc397c1c20c76e3d6fc460/src/base/Roles/BoringQueue/BoringOnChainQueue.sol#L431-L473) function.
  
      The [`BoringSolver.sol`](https://github.com/Se7en-Seas/boring-vault/blob/ec74b24330a1d7b144dc397c1c20c76e3d6fc460/src/base/Roles/BoringQueue/BoringSolver.sol) contract can fulfill more complex solves and has permission to make [`bulkWithdrawal()`](https://github.com/Se7en-Seas/boring-vault/blob/ec74b24330a1d7b144dc397c1c20c76e3d6fc460/src/base/Roles/TellerWithMultiAssetSupport.sol#L419-L436) and [`bulkDeposit()`](https://github.com/Se7en-Seas/boring-vault/blob/ec74b24330a1d7b144dc397c1c20c76e3d6fc460/src/base/Roles/TellerWithMultiAssetSupport.sol#L401-L417) calls on Boring Vaults which allows them to fulfill withdrawals for users in the withdrawal queue.
  
      The execution path for the BoringSolver is to call an initial external function it initiate the required solve type, like [`boringRedeemMintSolve()`](https://github.com/Se7en-Seas/boring-vault/blob/ec74b24330a1d7b144dc397c1c20c76e3d6fc460/src/base/Roles/BoringQueue/BoringSolver.sol#L60-L75), which then calls solveOnChainWithdrawals on the queue with the required `solveData`, with the `BoringOnChainQueue` calling back [`boringSolve()`](https://github.com/Se7en-Seas/boring-vault/blob/ec74b24330a1d7b144dc397c1c20c76e3d6fc460/src/base/Roles/BoringQueue/BoringSolver.sol#L121-L147) to complete the solve using the initially passed in `solveData`.
  
      However, `boringSolve()` is an external function that has no explicit permission guard, and assumes the caller is the queue:
  
      ```solidity
      function boringSolve(
          address initiator,
          address boringVault,
          address solveAsset,
          uint256 totalShares,
          uint256 requiredAssets,
          bytes calldata solveData
      ) external requiresAuth {
          if (initiator != address(this)) revert BoringSolver___WrongInitiator();
  
          address queue = msg.sender;
  
          SolveType solveType = abi.decode(solveData, (SolveType));
  
          if (solveType == SolveType.BORING_REDEEM) {
              _boringRedeemSolve(queue, solveData, boringVault, solveAsset, totalShares, requiredAssets);
          } else if (solveType == SolveType.BORING_REDEEM_MINT) {
              _boringRedeemMintSolve(queue, solveData, boringVault, solveAsset, totalShares, requiredAssets);
          } else {
              // Added for future protection, if another enum is added, txs with that enum will revert,
              // if no changes are made here.
              revert BoringSolver___FailedToSolve();
          }
      }
      ```
      Reference: [BoringSolver.sol#L121-L147](https://github.com/Se7en-Seas/boring-vault/blob/ec74b24330a1d7b144dc397c1c20c76e3d6fc460/src/base/Roles/BoringQueue/BoringSolver.sol#L121-L147)
  
      Any contract/eoa can pass the `initiator` as the BoringSolver contract address, send into the contract the desired boringVault shares and make use of it permission to withdraw via either solve type and get around the withdrawal delay.
      Users could leverage this and frontrun/backrun share price updates to immediately benefit without being required to hold onto shares long term. 
  
      **Remediations to Consider**
  
      Require the caller of `boringSolve()` to be a trusted withdrawal queue to prevent any user from taking advantage of `BoringSolver` permissions.
